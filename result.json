The full range of functionality of cell surface-expressed CD74 is not yet known. However, studies have demonstrated that CD74 is a receptor for the pro-inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF).

For instance, diagnostic and therapeutic agents have been linked to folate for internalization into cells expressing the folate receptor. See, e.g., Leamon, 2008 9:1277-1286; Paulos et al., 2004 56:1205-1217.",

FOLR1 expression is maintained in metastatic foci and recurrent carcinomas in ovarian cancer patients, and FOLR1 expression has been observed after chemotherapy in epithelial ovarian and endometrial cancers. These properties, together with the highly restricted expression of FOLR1 on normal tissues, make FOLR1 a highly promising target for cancer therapy. As such, the folate receptor provides a potential target for diagnostics and therapeutics for cancers and inflammatory conditions. New antibodies are needed for specific binding and targeting of these folate receptors.",

            "Zika virus (ZIKV) was identified in 1947 from a sentinel Rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda. Historically, ZIKV circulated between  species mosquitoes, non-human primates in the jungle, and episodically spilled into human populations in Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. Infection was associated with a mild, self-limiting febrile illness characterized by headache, rash, conjunctivitis, myalgia, and arthralgia. Since 2010, and especially in the context of its spread and dissemination to countries of the Western Hemisphere, more severe clinical consequences have been observed. Infection of fetuses in utero during pregnancy, particularly during the first and second trimesters, has been associated with placental insufficiency and congenital malformations including cerebral calcifications, microcephaly, and miscarriage. In adults, ZIKV infection is linked to an increased incidence of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disease characterized by paralysis and polyneuropathy. In addition to mosquito and in utero transmission, sexual transmission of ZIKV has been described from men-to-women, men-to-men, and women-to-men. Persistent ZIKV infection can occur, as viral RNA has been detected in semen, sperm, and vaginal secretions up to 6 months following infection. Thus, ZIKV is now a global disease with locally-acquired and travel-associated transmission through multiple routes in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. The emergence of ZIKV infection has prompted a global effort to develop safe and effective vaccines."

        "paragraph": [
            "Deaminases combined with the precise targeting of CRISPR-Cas proteins, termed nucleobase editors, have the ability to introduce specific point mutations into target polynucleotides. Nucleobase editors induce base changes without introducing double-stranded DNA breaks, and include adenosine base editors that convert target A\u00b7T to G\u00b7C and cytidine base editors that convert target C\u00b7G to T\u00b7A. However, introduction of nucleobase editors in cells has the potential to generate undesired base editor-associated edits, including genome-wide spurious deamination, bystander mutation, and target proximal edits. Spurious deamination events may occur throughout the genome, catalyzed by the base editor deamination domain acting independently of targeted base editing via programming of CRISPR-Cas domain by a guide RNA. Without being bound by theory, genome-wide spurious deamination events have the potential to occur where a single stranded DNA substrate is formed, for example due to \u201cDNA breathing\u201d or at DNA replication forks. Target proximal edits are base editing events that occur outside the on-target sequence, but are within \u02dc200 bp upstream or downstream of the targeted region. Bystander mutations are mutations that occur within the on-target, Cas9/sgRNA guided, base editing window which are not the desired target nucleobase. Bystander mutation may result in either silent mutation (no amino acid change) or non-synonymous mutation (amino acid change). Thus, there is a need for base editors having reduced non-target deamination."

            "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a genus of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae, in the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae. There are currently eight species in this genus, which have been identified and classified for different mammals, including humans, monkeys, and rodents. The most studied genus is human cytomegalovirus, also known as human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), which is widely distributed in the human population. Diseases associated with HHV-5 include mononucleosis and pneumonias. All herpesviruses share a characteristic ability to remain latent within the body over long periods of time. Although they may be found throughout the body, CMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands in humans and other mammals. Other CMV viruses are found in several mammal species, but species isolated from animals differ from HCMV in terms of genomic structure, and have not been reported to cause human disease.",
            "HCMV is endemic in most parts of the world. It is a ubiquitous large enveloped virus that infects 50 to 100% of the adult population worldwide. Although generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent hosts, HCMV infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised persons, such as infants following congenital or neonatal infections, transplant recipients, or AIDS patients.",
            "Primary infection normally results in subclinical disease after which the virus becomes latent, retaining the capacity to reactivate at a later time. The virus is transmitted through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk. In particular, individuals with undeveloped or compromised immunity are highly sensitive to infection by HCMV. It is estimated that at least 60% of the US population has been exposed to CMV, with a prevalence of more than 90% in high-risk groups (e.g., unborn babies whose mothers become infected with CMV during the pregnancy or people with HIV).",
            "In healthy individuals, HCMV typically causes an asymptomatic infection or produces mild, flulike symptoms. However, among two populations, HCMV is responsible for serious medical conditions. First, HCMV is a major cause of congenital defects in newborns infected in utero. Among congenitally infected newborns, 5-10% have major clinical symptoms at birth, such as microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, and hepatitis, as well as cytomegalic inclusion disease, which affects many tissues and organs including the central nervous system, liver, and retina and can lead to multi-organ failure and death. Other infants may be asymptomatic at birth, but later develop hearing loss or central nervous system abnormalities causing, in particular, poor intellectual performance and mental retardation. These pathologies are due in part to the ability of HCMV to enter and replicate in diverse cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, neurons, and monocytes/macrophages.",
            "The second population at risk are immunocompromised patients, such as those suffering from HIV infection and those undergoing transplantations. In this situation, the virus becomes an opportunistic pathogen and causes severe disease with high morbidity and mortality. The clinical disease causes a variety of symptoms including fever, pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, myelitis, colitis, uveitis, retinitis, and neuropathy. Rarer manifestations of HCMV infections in immunocompetent individuals include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, meningoencephalitis, pericarditis, myocarditis, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. Moreover, HCMV infection increases the risk of organ graft loss through transplant vascular sclerosis and restenosis, and may increase atherosclerosis in transplant patients as well as in the general population. It is estimated that HCMV infection causes clinical disease in 75% of patients in the first year after transplantation.",
            "There is currently no approved HCMV vaccine. Two candidate vaccines, Towne and gB/MF59, have completed phase II efficacy trials. The Towne vaccine appears protective against both infection and disease caused by challenge with pathogenic Toledo strain and also appears to be effective in preventing severe post-transplantation CMV disease. However, in a small phase II clinical trial, a low dose of Towne vaccine failed to show protection against infection of seronegative mothers who had children actively shedding CMV.",
            "The gB/MF59 vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine comprised of a transmembrane-deleted version of HCMV gB protein, which induces high levels of fibroblast entry neutralizing antibodies in humans and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in both adults and toddlers. A recent phase II double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the gB/MF59 vaccine revealed a 50% efficacy in inducing sterilizing immunity. As this vaccine induces potent antibody responses but very weak T-cell responses, the partial efficacy provided by the vaccine is thought to be primarily antibody-mediated. While this HCMV vaccine is the first to show any protective efficacy, its 50% protection falls short of the 80-90% desired for most vaccines.",
            "In addition, antibody therapy has been used to control HCMV infection in immunocompromised individuals and to reduce the pathological consequences of maternal-fetal transmission, although such therapy is usually not sufficient to eradicate the virus. HCMV immunoglobulins (Igs) have been administered to transplant patients in association with immunosuppressive treatments for prophylaxis of HCMV disease with mixed results. Antibody therapy has also been used to control congenital infection and prevent disease in newborns. However, these products are plasma derivatives with relatively low potency and have to be administered by intravenous infusion at very high doses in order to deliver sufficient amounts of neutralizing antibodies.",
            "HCMV is the leading viral cause of neurodevelopmental abnormality and other birth defects in children and the costs to society are substantial. Although antiviral therapy is available, the treatment with antiviral agents is imperfect and development of a CMV vaccine is the most promising strategy for preventing CMV infection. Given that the health and economic benefits of effective HCMV vaccines are significant, the US Institute of Medicine and US National Vaccine Program Office has categorized development of a CMV vaccine as a highest priority, but no candidate vaccine is under consideration for licensure."

        "paragraph": [
            "Propionic acidemia (PA), or propionic aciduria, is a rare, autosomal recessive metabolic disorder with significant morbidity and mortality that is caused by a deficiency in propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) that prevents the enzyme from catalyzing the carboxylation of propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA. Wongkittichote et al.,  ., Epub ahead of print. (2017). Disruption of PCC function causes propionyl-CoA and metabolites of propionate metabolism (breakdown of certain amino acids and fats) to accumulate in the blood, urine and other fluids and tissues/cells, which can lead to metabolic acidosis and hyperammonemia. Propionylcarnitine (C3), the levocarnitine ester of propionyl-CoA, 2-methylcitirc acid (2-MC), 3-hydroxypropionic acid (30HPA), propionylglycine, glycine, lactate and ammonia are also elevated in individuals with PA, and can serve as biomarkers for the disorder. Classical PA, caused by a complete loss of PCC function, usually presents in neonates in the first few hours or days after birth, with symptoms resulting from metabolic decompensation, including poor feeding, vomiting, hyper- or hypotonia, temperature instability, irritability, and lethargy. In rarer cases, late onset PA can occur after infancy, triggered by physical stress, such as infection. Mistreatment of acute metabolic discompensation, or lack of treatment, can lead to coma or death. The risk of mortality in this disorder is significant, as each acute metabolic decompensation is life-threatening and can lead to irreversible sequelae. Long-term complications of PA include neurodevelopmental sequelae, including significant cognitive deficits and developmental delays in motor and language skills, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, and pancreatitis. PA has an estimated incidence of 1:105,000 to 1:130,000 in the United States, but is higher in parts of the Middle East. Shchelochkov et al.,  (2016).",
            "PCC (E.C. 6.4.1.3) is a heterodecamer composed of six propionyl-CoA carboxylase alpha subunits, encoded by PCCA (OMIM 232000), and 6 propionyl-CoA beta subunits, encoded by PCCB (OMIM 232050). The PCC enzyme is expressed in several tissues, and localizes to mitochondria where it engages with its necessary co-factor, biotin. There are three PCCA isoforms. The first isoform (NM_000282.3) encodes a protein (NP 000273.2) that is 728 amino acids in length, while isoform 2 (NM_001127692.2) encodes a protein (NP 001121164.1) that is 702 amino acids long, and isoform 3 (NM_001178004.1) encodes a protein (NP_001171475.1) that is 681 amino acids long. PCCA null variants, such as R288X and S537X, result in severe phenotypes, while splice type variants can result in milder disease. PCCB isoform 1 (NM_000532.4 encodes a protein (NP_000523.2) that is 539 amino acids in length, while isoform 2 (NM_001178014.1) encodes a protein (NP_001171485.1) that is 559 amino acids long. PCCB requires PCCA for stability, and can be absent in individuals lacking functional PCCA. Some PCCB gene variants disturb the interaction between PCCA and PCCB.",
            "Elevated levels of intermediaries such as C3, 2-MC, 3-OHPA, and/or ammonia can be used as diagnostic markers for PA. Prenatal testing of 2-MC levels in amniotic fluids and newborn screening for elevated levels of C3 in dried blood spot can be used to diagnose PA prior to clinical presentation of the disease postpartum. There are no approved therapies for PA in the U.S., and management of the disorder is limited generally to the strict dietary restriction of amino acids and odd-chain fatty acids, the precursors of propionic acid, while ensuring sufficient essential amino acids and nutrients to the diet, camitine supplementation, antibiotics to decrease propionate production from gut bacteria, and vigilant medical monitoring. Acutely hyperammonemic individuals may require detoxification using ammonia scavengers such as Carbaglu\u00ae (which is approved in Europe for the treatment of hyperammonemia due to PA) and/or sodium benzoate. In severe cases, an individual could receive a liver transplant.",

Genome engineering is a very active field of research because of the wide range of possible applications, particularly in the areas of human health. For example, genome engineering can be used to alter (e.g., correct or knock-out) a gene carrying a harmful mutation or to explore the function of a gene. Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disrupting normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unwanted effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells. Recent genome engineering strategies, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), homing endonucleases (HEs) and MegaTALs, enable a specific area of the DNA to be modified, thereby increasing the precision of the alteration compared to early technologies. These newer platforms offer a much larger degree of reproducibility, but still have their limitations.",

This can be achieved within the cellular environment or in vitro using lysates derived from cells.",
            "In vitro, or cell-free, protein synthesis offers several advantages over conventional in vivo protein expression methods. Cell-free systems can direct most, if not all, of the metabolic resources of the cell towards the exclusive production of one protein. Moreover, the lack of a cell wall and membrane components in vitro is advantageous because it allows for control of the synthesis environment. For example, tRNA levels can be changed to reflect the codon usage of genes being expressed. The redox potential, pH, or ionic strength can also be altered with greater flexibility than with in vivo protein synthesis because concerns of cell growth or viability do not exist. Furthermore, direct recovery of purified, properly folded protein products can be easily achieved.",

Such improvement has made in vitro protein synthesis a practical technique for laboratory-scale research and provided a platform technology for high-throughput protein expression. It further indicates the feasibility for using cell-free technologies as an alternative means to in vivo large-scale commercial production of protein pharmaceuticals.",
            "The productivity of in vitro polypeptide synthesis systems can be significantly hindered by bacterial contamination. While many commercially available antibiotics exist for use to inhibit bacterial growth that occurs within an in vitro reaction lysate, most of these antibiotics interfere with protein synthesis or are not acceptable for production of pharmaceuticals. There exists a need for antibiotic application for eliminating bacterial growth in an in vitro polypeptide synthesis reaction lysate without interfering with the in vitro protein synthesis reaction, such that the output of the desired polypeptide is permitted and/or enhanced. The invention described herein fulfills these needs, as will be apparent upon review of the following disclosure."

Several potential CHIKV vaccine candidates have been tested in humans and animals with varying success.",
            "Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne ( ) member of the family Flaviviridae (positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus). Dengue virus is a positive-sense RNA virus of the  genus of the Flaviviridae family, which also includes West Nile virus, Yellow Fever Virus, and Japanese Encephalitis virus. It is transmitted to humans through  (formerly  ) mosquito vectors and is mainly found in the tropical and semitropical areas of the world, where it is endemic in Asia, the Pacific region, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The incidence of infections has increased 30-fold over the last 50 years (WHO, Dengue: Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control (2009)) and Dengue virus is the second most common tropical infectious disease worldwide after malaria.",
            "There is no specific treatment for DENV infection, and control of DENV by vaccination has proved elusive, in part, because the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS is not completely understood. While infection with one serotype confers lifelong homotypic immunity, it confers only short term (approximately three to six months) cross protection against heterotypic serotypes. Also, there is evidence that prior infection with one type can produce an antibody response that can intensify, or enhance, the course of disease during a subsequent infection with a different serotype. The possibility that vaccine components could elicit enhancing antibody responses, as opposed to protective responses, has been a major concern in designing and testing vaccines to protect against dengue infections.",
            "In late 2015 and early 2016, the first dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV) by Sanofi Pasteur, was registered in several countries for use in individuals 9-45 years of age living in endemic areas. Issues with the vaccine include (1) weak protection against DENV1 and DENV2 (<60% efficacy); (2) relative risk of dengue hospitalization among children <9 years old (7.5\u00d7 higher than placebo); (3) immunogenicity not sustained after 1-2 years (implying the need for a 4 dose booster); and (4) lowest efficacy against DENV2, which often causes more severe conditions. This latter point is a major weakness with the Dengvaxia vaccine, signaling the need of a new, more effective vaccine effective against DENV2. Other tetravalent live-attenuated vaccines are under development in phase II and phase III clinical trials, and other vaccine candidates (based on subunit, DNA and purified inactivated virus platforms) are at earlier stages of clinical development, although the ability of these vaccine candidates to provide broad serotype protection has not been demonstrated.",
            "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Flaviviridae virus family and the  genus. In humans, it causes a disease known as Zika fever. It is related to dengue, yellow fever, West Nile and Japanese encephalitis, viruses that are also members of the virus family Flaviviridae. ZIKV is spread to people through mosquito bites. The most common symptoms of ZIKV disease (Zika) are fever, rash, joint pain, and red eye. The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week. There is no vaccine to prevent, or medicine to treat, Zika virus.",
            "Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccination is one technique used to stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses to foreign antigens, such as ZIKV antigens. The direct injection of genetically engineered DNA (e.g., naked plasmid DNA) into a living host results in a small number of its cells directly producing an antigen, resulting in a protective immunological response. With this technique, however, comes potential problems, including the possibility of insertional mutagenesis, which could lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inhibition of tumor suppressor genes."

        "abstract": "The present application provides materials and methods for treating hemoglobinopathies. More specifically, the application provides methods for producing progenitor cells that are genetically modified via genome editing to increase the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), as well as modified progenitor cells (including, for example, CD34+ human hematopoietic stem cells) producing increased levels of HbF, and methods of using such cells for treating hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell anemia and \u03b2-thalassemia.",
        "paragraph": [
            "Hemoglobinopathies encompass a number of anemias that are associated with changes in the genetically determined structure or expression of hemoglobin. These include changes to the molecular structure of the hemoglobin chain, such as occurs with sickle cell anemia, as well as changes in which synthesis of one or more chains is reduced or absent, such as occurs in various thalassemias.",
            "Disorders specifically associated with the \u03b2-globin protein are referred to generally as \u03b2-hemoglobinopathies. For example, \u03b2-thalassemias result from a partial or complete defect in the expression of the \u03b2-globin gene, leading to deficient or absent hemoglobin A (HbA). HbA is the most common human hemoglobin tetramer and consists of two \u03b1-chains and two \u03b2-chains (\u03b1 \u03b2 ). \u03b2-thalassemias are due to mutations in the adult \u03b2-globin gene (HBB) on chromosome 11, and are inherited in an autosomal, recessive fashion. \u03b2-thalassemia or \u03b2-thal is classified into two clinically-significant types (which are a focus of symptom management, medical treatments and the present application) that are distinguished by the severity of symptoms: \u03b2-thalassemia major (or \u03b2 , in which mutations block production of \u03b2-globin chains, resulting in a severe condition that is also known as \u201cCooley's anemia\u201d) and \u03b2-thalassemia intermedia (or \u03b2 , an intermediate condition in which mutations reduce but do not block production of \u03b2-globin chains). In contrast, \u03b2-thalassemia minor or \u03b2-thalassemia trait refers to the heterozygous situation in which only one of the \u03b2-globin alleles contains a mutation, so that \u03b2-globin chains can be produced via expression from the other (i.e. unmutated) chromosome 11 allele. While such individuals are carriers of a \u03b2-thalassemia mutant allele that they may pass on to their children, individuals with \u03b2-thalassemia minor are generally either asymptomatic or nearly asymptomatic themselves as a result of \u03b2-globin production from the unaffected allele.",
            "The signs and symptoms of thalassemia major generally appear within the first 2 years of life, when children with the disease can develop life-threatening anemia. Children with thalassemia major often fail to gain sufficient weight or grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive) and may develop jaundice. Affected individuals may also have an enlarged spleen, liver, and heart, and their bones may be misshapen. Many people with thalassemia major have such severe symptoms that they need frequent blood transfusions to replenish their red blood cell supply, which is referred to as transfusion-dependent thalassemia. While transfusions have been a critical life-saver for many patients, they are expensive and are frequently associated with significant side effects. Among others, over time the administration of iron-containing hemoglobin from chronic blood transfusions tends to lead to a buildup of iron in the body, which can result in liver, heart, and endocrine problems.",
            "Thalassemia  is milder than thalassemia major. The signs and symptoms of thalassemia  appear in early childhood or later in life. Although symptoms are less severe, affected individuals still have mild to moderate anemia and may also suffer from slow growth and bone abnormalities.",
            "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of disorders that affects millions of people worldwide. It is most common among people who live in or whose ancestors come from Africa; Mediterranean countries such as Greece, Turkey, and Italy; the Arabian Peninsula; India; Spanish-speaking regions in Central and South America, and parts of the Caribbean. However, SCD is also the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States. SCD includes sickle cell anemia, as well as sickle hemoglobin C disease (HbSC), sickle beta-plus-thalassemia (HbS/\u03b2 ) and sickle beta-zero-thalassemia)(HbS/\u03b2 ).",
            "Sickle cell anemia (SCA), which is the most prevalent form of SCD, is among the most common severe monogenic disorders worldwide, with approximately 250,000 children born with SCD every year. The incidence of SCA is greatest in West and Central Africa, where 1-2% of babies are born with the disease, and as many as 25% of people are heterozygous carriers. The SCA point mutation is believed to have been spread through selective advantage because heterozygosity provides modest protection against death from childhood malaria. In India, where malaria is also prevalent, it is estimated that there are more than 2.5 million heterozygous carriers of SCA and approximately 150,000 homozygotes with the disease.",
            "Despite the relative absence of malaria in North America and Europe, the fact that each has large populations with genetic origins in affected areas has meant that both regions have substantial populations of heterozygous SCA carriers, and therefore affected homozygous individuals. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that there are approximately 90,000 to 100,000 Americans with SCA; and incidence is also high in countries of Western Europe, particularly those with large immigrant populations, with an estimated 10,000 in France and 12,000 to 15,000 in the United Kingdom for example. Associated costs to healthcare systems are likewise substantial. In a five-year US study conducted from 1989 through 1993, the CDC estimated that SCD resulted in more than 75,000 hospitalizations annually, and cost approximately $0.5 billion. System wide costs would be expected to be substantially greater now given the steady rise in healthcare costs over the intervening two decades.",
            "All forms of SCD are caused by mutations in the \u03b2-globin structural gene (HBB). Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a single missense mutation in the sixth codon of the \u03b2-globin gene (HBB; A\u2192T) resulting in the substitution of glutamic acid by valine (Glu\u2192Val). The mutant protein, when incorporated into hemoglobin (Hb), results in unstable hemoglobin HbS (which is \u03b1 \u03b2 ) in contrast to normal adult hemoglobin or HbA (which is \u03b1 \u03b2 ). Upon de-oxygenation, HbS polymerizes to form HbSS through hydrophobic interactions between \u03b2 -6 valine of one tetramer and \u03b2-85 phenylalanine and \u03b2-88 leucine of an adjacent tetramer in the erythron, which leads to rigidity and vaso-occlusion [Atweh,  38(4):367-73 (2001)].",
            "When HbS is the predominant form of hemoglobin, as in individuals with SCA, their red blood cells (RBCs) tend to be distorted into a sickle or crescent shape. The sickle-shaped RBCs die prematurely, which can lead to anemia. In addition, the sickle-shaped cells are less flexible than normal RBCs and tend to get stuck in small blood vessels causing vaso-occlusive events. Such vaso-occlusive events are associated with tissue ischemia leading to acute and chronic pain as well as organ damage that can affect any organ in the body, including the bones, lungs, liver, kidneys, brain, eyes, and joints. The spleen is particularly subject to infarction and the majority of individuals with SCD are functionally asplenic in early childhood, increasing their risk for certain types of bacterial infections. Occlusions of small vessels can also cause acute episodic febrile illness called \u201ccrises,\u201d which are associated with severe pain and multiple organ dysfunction. Over the course of decades there is progressive organ disease and premature death.",
            "Children with SCD may be diagnosed by newborn screening but otherwise do not present until later, when levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) decline and levels of HbS increase as a result of the hemoglobin allelic \u201cswitch\u201d from fetal hemoglobin (encoded by HBG1 (A-gamma, also written  \u03b3) and HBG2 (G-gamma, also written  \u03b3)) to the adult \u03b2 form encoded by HBB). The switch from HbF to the adult form of \u03b2-globin (i.e. HbA in unaffected children or HbS in those with SCA) typically begins a few months prior to birth and is complete by about the age of 6 months. The clinical effects of SCD are not manifested until HbF levels become significantly low relative to HbS, which typically occurs two to three months after birth. SCD often first presents as dactylitis or \u201chand-foot syndrome,\u201d a condition associated with pain in the hands and/or feet that may be accompanied by swelling. In addition, the spleen can become engorged with blood cells resulting in a condition known as \u201csplenic sequestration.\u201d Hemolysis associated with SCD can result in anemia, jaundice, cholelithiasis, as well as delayed growth. Individuals with the highest rates of SCD hemolysis also tend to experience pulmonary artery hypertension, priapism, and leg ulcers.",
            "Sickle cell anemia (homozygous HbSS) accounts for 60%-70% of sickle cell disease in the US. The other forms of sickle cell disease result from coinheritance of HbS with other abnormal globin \u03b2 chain variants, the most common forms being sickle-hemoglobin C disease (HbSC) and two types of sickle \u03b2-thalassemia (HbS\u03b2+-thalassemia and HbS\u03b2\u00b0-thalassemia). The \u03b2-thalassemias are divided into \u03b2+-thalassemia, in which reduced levels of normal \u03b2-globin chains are produced, and \u03b2\u00b0-thalassemia, in which there is no \u03b2-globin chain synthesis. Other globin \u03b2 chain variants such as D-Punjab, O-Arab, and E also result in sickle cell disease when coinherited with HbS.",
            "Although improvements in the management of SCD have reduced mortality in affected children followed up since neonatal screening, the mainstay of treatment for the majority of individuals with SCD remains supportive. Current treatments aim at relieving symptoms and treating complications such as: pain from vaso-occlusive crisis, infection, anemia, stroke, priapism, pulmonary hypertension or chronic organ damage. Preventative therapies include infection prophylaxis with regular penicillin, vaccination against  and  , as well as regular transfusions in children with abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to prevent strokes and iron chelation for transfusional iron overload. Stroke is also considered an indication for bone marrow transplantation in children and adolescents, who have siblings with identical human leukocyte antigen (HLA). Effective treatment of acute pain is one of the most common problems raised by the management of SCA. Thus, at the present time, definitive therapies that substantially alter the natural history of the disease (such as regular transfusion or exchange transfusion, long-term hydroxycarbamide and HSC transplants) are limited.",
            "WO2014/085593 relates to methods and compositions for treating hemoglobinopathies by targeting BCL11A distal regulatory elements that are purported to act as a stage specific regulator of fetal hemoglobin expression by repressing \u03b3-globin induction. Thus, for example, claim   of WO2014/085593 is directed to a method for producing a progenitor cell having decreased BCL11A mRNA or protein expression, the method comprising contacting an isolated progenitor cell with an agent that binds the genomic DNA of the cell on chromosome 2 location 60,716,189-60,728,612 (according to UCSC Genome Browser hg 19 human genome assembly), thereby reducing the mRNA or protein expression of BCL11A.",
            "For these and other targets, gene therapy has long been proposed as a potentially curative option for hemoglobinopathies (see, e.g., de Montalembert,  337: a1397 (2008); Sheth et al.,  162: 455-464 (2013), and references cited therein.",
            "However, as recently summarized by Chandrakasan and Malik in a review entitled \u201cGene Therapy for Hemoglobinopathies: The State of the Field and the Future\u201d [ 28(2): 199-216 (2014)] gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies has faced a number of challenges. For example, retroviral (RV) vectors were the first vectors to be used in clinical trials, and although vectors with long terminal repeats (LTRs) intact mediated high levels of transgene expression leading to clinical improvement, the success in the trials were soon marred by safety concerns from insertional oncogenesis from transactivation of cellular oncogenes by the RV LTR. The lympho-proliferation and leukemia in X-SCID was ascribed to insertion activation of the LMO2 oncogene. In the gene therapy trial for chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), after some initial success, there was silencing of transgene expression caused by methylation of the viral promoter, and myelodysplasia developed with monosomy 7 as a result of insertional activation of ecotropic viral integration site 1. Cf. Chandrakasan and Malik, supra, and references cited therein.",
            "Bioengineering of HIV-1 devoid of any pathogenic elements resulted in the development of lentivirus (LV) vectors. Initial studies had established LV vectors as dependable vehicles for high-efficiency gene transfer. Bluebird Bio, Inc. is developing LentiGlobin\u00ae BB305, as a potential treatment in which autologous CD34  hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are transduced ex vivo with a lentiviral \u03b2 -globin vector with the goal of inserting a fully functional human \u03b2-globin gene in patients with \u03b2-thalassemia major. The Bluebird study is intended to build on early clinical data from the LG001 study, in which the drug product had been administered to a patient with \u03b2-thalassemia major [Cavazzana-Calvo et al.,  467: 318-322 (2010)].",
            "Gene therapy using \u03b3-globin has also been considered. However, \u03b3-globin transcripts are known to be highly silenced in adults and so approaches to circumvent this have included driving \u03b3-globin expression with \u03b2-globin promoters and enhancers, as described by Chandrakasan and Malik, supra.",
            "However, the introduction of strong promoters and enhancers in the context of gene therapy, particularly with vectors that integrate at unpredictable locations within the genome (which include RV and LV vectors), raises safety concerns since the activation of a proto-oncogene or other harmful event can be triggered by the introduction of such elements. In the severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) trials, for example, 5 of the 20 patients treated developed leukemia in connection with their treatment [Wu et al.  5(4): 356-371 (2011)].",
            "In sum, despite decades of efforts from researchers and medical professionals worldwide who have been trying to address hemoglobinopathies such \u03b2-thalassemia and sickle cell disease, and despite the promise of gene therapy approaches, there still remains a critical need for developing safe and effective treatments for these and related diseases which are among the most prevalent and debilitating genetic disorders."

            "The circulatory system permits blood and lymph circulation to transport, e.g., nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide, cellular waste products, hormones, cytokines, blood cells, and pathogens to and from cells in the body. Blood is a fluid comprising, e.g., plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets that is circulated by the heart through the vertebrate vascular system. The circulatory system becomes a reservoir for many toxins and pathogenic molecules upon their introduction to or production by the body. The circulatory system also serves as a reservoir for cellular secretions or detritus from within the body. The perpetual or aberrant circulation and proliferation of such molecules and entities can drive disease and/or exacerbate existing conditions.",
            "The efficacy of therapeutic compositions that alleviate or prevent diseases and conditions associated with the circulatory system is often limited by their half-life, which is typically up to a few days. The short half-life often necessitates repeated injections and hospitalizations. It is thought that the short half-life may be due to both renal clearance, e.g., of proteins smaller than 60 kDa, and non-renal clearance, e.g., via liver excretion or immune-mediated removal. The activity of therapies is also often limited by an immune reaction elicited against them (see, e.g., Wang et al., Leukemia 2003, 17:1583). Several approaches are practiced in the art.",
            "One approach includes the use of \u201cerythrocyte ghosts\u201d that are derived from a hemolyzed red blood cell. To prepare erythrocyte ghosts, red blood cells undergo hypotonic lysis. The red blood cells are exposed to low ionic strength buffer causing them to burst. The resulting lysed cell membranes are isolated by centrifugation. The pellet of lysed red blood cell membranes is resuspended and incubated in the presence of the therapeutic agent, for example, such as an antibiotic or chemotherapeutic agent in a low ionic strength buffer. The therapeutic agent distributes within the cells. Erythrocyte ghosts and derivatives used to encapsulate payloads, such as therapeutic agents, can shield those payloads from the immune system, but the erythrocyte ghosts themselves are subject to rapid clearance by the reticulo-endothelial system (see, e.g., Loegering et al. 1987 Infect Immun 55(9):2074). Erythrocyte ghosts also elicit an immune response in mammalian subjects. These vesicles are typically constituted of both lipids and proteins, including potentially high amounts of phosphatidylserine, which is normally found on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This leads to potential immunological reactions in the recipient mammalian subjects. The undesirable effects seriously limit the potential for therapeutic applications of technologies based on erythrocyte ghosts.",
            "Another approach for drug encapsulation includes the use of exosomes. \u201cExosomes\u201d include cell-derived vesicles that are present in many and perhaps all biological fluids, including blood, urine, and cultured medium of cell cultures. The reported diameter of exosomes is between 30 and 100 nm, which is larger than low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but smaller than, for example, red blood cells. Exosomes are either released from the cell when multivesicular bodies fuse with the plasma membrane or they are released directly from the plasma membrane. Exosome delivery methods require a better understanding of their biology, as well as the development of production, characterization, targeting and cargo-loading nanotechnologies. Attempts have been made to manufacture exosomes using human embryonic stem cell derived mesenchymal stem cells (hESC-MSCs). However, as hESC-MSCs are not infinitely expansible, large scale production of exosomes would require replenishment of hESC-MSC through derivation from hESCs and incur recurring costs for testing and validation of each new batch (Chen et al. 2011 Journal of Translational Medicine 9:47). Clinical translation is also hindered by the lack of suitable and scalable nanotechnologies for the purification and loading of exosomes (Lakhal and Wood 2011 BioEssays 33(10):737). Current ultracentrifugation protocols are commercially unreproducible, as they produce a heterogeneous mix of exosomes, other cellular vesicles and macromolecular complexes. Therefore, purification methods based on the use of specific, desired markers, such as the expression of a targeting moiety on the surface of the exosome, are required. In addition, siRNA loading into exosomes is relatively inefficient and cost-ineffective, highlighting the need for the development of transfection reagents tailored for nanoparticle applications. Further, exosomes are rapidly cleared from circulation and substantially accumulate in the liver within 24 hours of administration (Ohno et al., 2013 Mol Therapy 21(1):185), limiting their application for long-term drug delivery to the circulatory of a subject.",
            "Polyethylene glycol-coated liposomes are presently used as carriers for in vivo drug delivery. A \u201cliposome\u201d includes an artificially-prepared spherical vesicle composed of a lamellar phase lipid bilayer. The liposome can be used as a vehicle for administration of nutrients and pharmaceutical agents. Liposomes can be prepared by disrupting biological membranes, e.g., by sonication. Liposomes are often composed of phosphatidylcholine-enriched phospholipids and may also contain mixed lipid chains with surfactant properties such as egg phosphatidylethanolamine A liposome design may employ surface ligands for attaching to a target, e.g., unhealthy tissue. Types of liposomes include the multilamellar vesicle (MLV), the small unilamellar liposome vesicle (SUV), the large unilamellar vesicle (LUV), and the cochleate vesicle. Liposomes as carriers of anthracycline antibiotics have been a subject of a great number of studies. As a result, liposome formulations of daunorubicin (DaunoXome\u2122) and doxorubicin (Doxil\u2122) are now commercially available. The pharmacokinetics of the liposomal forms of anthracycline antibiotics differ from that of their free forms in higher peak concentrations and longer circulations times of the drugs. The kinetics of DaunoXome and Doxil clearance from plasma is close to mono-exponential. The half-life of DaunoXome in patient plasma is on the order of a few hours. In Doxil, polyethylene glycol-coated liposomes are used. The immune system poorly recognizes such liposomes; therefore the plasma half-life of Doxil is in the order of tens of hours.",
            "Red blood cells have been considered for use, e.g., to degrade toxic metabolites or inactivate xenobiotics, as drug delivery systems, as carriers of antigens for vaccination, and in other biomedical applications (Magnani Ed. 2003, Erythrocyte Engineering for Drug Delivery and Targeting). Many of these applications require procedures for the transient opening of pores across the red cell membrane. Drugs have commonly been loaded into freshly isolated red blood cells, without culturing, using disruptive methods based on hypotonic shock. Hypotonic dialysis can induce a high degree of hemolysis, irreversible modifications in the morphology of the cells and phosphotidyl serine exposure, which has been recognized as an important parameter associated with premature red blood cells removal and induction of transfusion-related pathologies (Favretto 2013 J Contr Rel).",
            "Many drugs, particularly protein therapeutics, stimulate immunogenic responses that include B cell antibody production, T cell activation, and macrophage phagocytosis. The causes of immunogenicity can be extrinsic or intrinsic to the protein. Extrinsic factors are drug formulation, aggregate formation, degradation products, contaminants and dosing. The administration mode, as well as the drug regimen, also strongly influences how immunogenicity is assessed. That is, immunogenicity will have different effects for drugs that are given in acute indications compared to drugs to treat chronic diseases. In the latter case, patients are exposed to the drug over a longer period of time and as such can mount a complete response. Pegylation is a technology designed to prolong the half-life, as well as minimize immunogenic responses. In contrast to assumptions that polyethylene glycol (PEG) is non-immunogenic and non-antigenic, certain animal studies show that uricase, ovalbumin and some other PEGylated agents can elicit antibody formation against PEG (anti-PEG). In humans, anti-PEG may limit therapeutic efficacy and/or reduce tolerance of PEG-asparaginase (PEG-ASNase) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and of pegloticase in patients with chronic gout, but did not impair hyposensitization of allergic patients with mPEG-modified ragweed extract or honeybee venom or the response to PEG-IFN in patients with hepatitis C. Anti-PEG antibodies can be found in 22-25% of healthy blood donors. Two decades earlier, the occurrence was 0.2%. This increase may be due to an improvement of the limit of detection of antibodies and to greater exposure to PEG and PEG-containing compounds in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and processed food products. These results raise concerns regarding the efficacy of PEG-conjugated drugs for a subset of patients (Garay, Expert Opin Drug Deliv, 2012 9(11):1319).",
            "Attempts in the art to create passive half-life improvement methods focus on increasing the apparent hydrodynamic radius of a drug. The kidney's glomerular filtration apparatus is the primary site in the body where blood components are filtered, see for reference e.g., Osicka et al. Clin Sci 1997 93:65 and Myers et al. Kidney Int 1982 21:633. The main determinant of filtration is the hydrodynamic radius of the molecule in the blood; smaller molecules (<80 kDa) are filtered out of the blood to a higher extent than larger molecules. Researchers have used this generalized rule to modify drugs to exhibit a larger hydrodynamic radius and thus longer half-life, mainly via chemical conjugation to large molecular weight water-soluble polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). Numerous PEGylated protein and small molecule therapeutics are currently offered in the clinic (Pasut and Veronese, 2009 Adv Drug Deliv Rev 61(13):1177; Fishburn, 2008 J Pharm Sci 97(10):4167). Though effective in many cases in increasing circulation half-life, especially as the hydrodynamic radius of the graft or fusion increases (Gao, Liu, et al., 2009 PNAS 106(36):15231), these methods offer challenges in manufacturing and maintenance of biological effector function. Heterogeneities in conjugation reactions can cause complex product mixtures with varying biological activities, due mostly to the utilization of site-unspecific chemistries. Extensive biochemical characterization often follows precise purification methods to retain a homogenous therapeutic product (Huang, Gough, et al, 2009 Anal Chem 81(2):567; Bailon, Palleroni, et al., 2001 Bioconj Chem 12(2):195; Dhalluin, Ross, et al., 2005 Bioconj Chem 16(3):504). Furthermore, attachment of large moieties, such as branched PEGs, to reactive zones of proteins can lead to decreased receptor affinity (Fishburn, 2008 J Pharm Sci 97(10):4167).",
            "Albumin may be used to bind a therapeutic protein for increased circulation of the drug (Dennis et al, 2002 J Bil Chem 277(38):35035; Walker, Dunlevy, et al., 2010 Prot Engr Des Sel 23(4):271) to increase the apparent size of the therapeutic by engineering it to bind another protein in the blood. In this manner, the drug attains its large molecular size only after administration into the blood stream. The addition of affinity-matured serum albumin-binding peptides to antibody fragments increased their circulation time 24 fold in mice (Dennis et al, 2002 J Bil Chem 277(38):35035). This method is complicated by the dynamics of albumin recycle by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and the use of cysteine-constrained cyclic peptides for functionality. Alternatively, recombinant addition of large antibody fragments may be made to a protein drug. This may cause structural as well as manufacturing complications, e.g., because of the use of complex cyclic or large domains for functionality. Despite high affinity for albumin, they require the physical constraint of correctly forming a cyclic structure prior to use. Methods of fusing larger antibody fragments may not be amendable to proteins with an already complex folding structure or low expression yield.",
            "The potential of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, antibody-coupled T-cell receptor (ACTR) therapies and other adoptive T-cell therapies in effecting complete and durable responses has been demonstrated in a number of malignant and infectious diseases. The development of more potent T cells is limited, however, by safety concerns, highlighted by the occurrence of on-target and off-target toxicities that, although uncommon, have been fatal on occasions. Timely pharmacological intervention can be effective in the management of adverse events but adoptively transferred T cells can persist long term, along with any unwanted effects. T cells targeting differentiation antigens can be expected to also recognize nonmalignant cells that express the same antigens, resulting in adverse events. For example, melanoma patients treated with T cells targeting melanocyte differentiation antigens, such as MART-1 and gp100, often develop vitiligo and uveitis. These on-target toxicities have been observed across all forms of therapeutic approaches, including tumor-infiltrating cells, in vitro-expanded T-cell clones and TCR-transgenic cells. In general, on-target autoimmunity is associated with tumor regression and is more prominent in treatment approaches that are more efficacious. On-target but off-tumour toxicities can be immediately life-threatening. For example, patients with colorectal cancer with lung and liver metastases may develop respiratory distress within 15 min of HER2-specific CAR T-cell infusion and may subsequently die from multiorgan failure 5 days later. As T-cell therapy becomes more effective, acute toxicities have also become more evident. Cytokine release syndrome, which is characterized by fevers, rigors, hypotension and hypoxia, has been observed in a number of CD19 CAR T-cell studies as a result of large-scale T-cell activation upon the recognition of CD19+ malignant cells.",
            "There is an ongoing need to provide therapeutic compositions through the circulatory system that alleviate or prevent such diseases and conditions. There is a further a need for methods and compositions that increase the half-life, safety profile, and/or efficacy of such therapeutic compositions. Aspects of the invention address one or more of the shortcomings of current methods and compositions."

As a direct source of gene products, mRNA has several advantages including a lack of requirement for nuclear entry, which poses a significant barrier to DNA delivery, especially in non-dividing cells. mRNA also has a negligible chance of integrating into the host genome, avoiding aberrant transcription and expression of oncogenes caused by insertional mutagenesis.",
            "For a given gene, the untranslated gene regions (UTRs), including the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs, are regions involved in the regulation of expression. The 5\u2032 UTR is a regulatory region of DNA situated at the 5\u2032 end of all protein coding sequence that is transcribed into mRNA but not translated into protein. 5\u2032 UTRs may contain various regulatory elements, e.g., 5\u2032 cap structure, G-quadruplex structure (G4), stem-loop structure, and internal ribosome entry sites (IRES), which play a major role in the control of translation initiation. The 3\u2032 UTR, situated downstream of the protein coding sequence, has been found to be involved in numerous regulatory processes including transcript cleavage, stability and polyadenylation, translation, and mRNA localization. The 3\u2032 UTR serves as a binding site for numerous regulatory proteins and small non-coding RNAs, e.g., microRNAs.",

ADCs, for example, consist of a tumor antigen-specific antibody that is coupled to a chemotherapeutic small molecule cytotoxin. Through targeted delivery of potent cytotoxins, protein drug conjugates exhibit improved therapeutic index over traditional chemotherapies with enhanced efficacy relative to standard monoclonal antibody therapies. However, current methods utilize nonspecific modes of conjugation of drugs to proteins, thereby leading to heterogeneous drug products with varied numbers of drugs conjugated across a number of possible sites. Technical challenges associated with drug conjugation to proteins using naturally occurring amino acids, are primarily due to heterogeneous degrees and location of drug loading as well as conjugate instability.",
            "In order to reduce product heterogeneity, several groups have reported site-directed approaches that utilize substituted cysteines or enzymatic modification of engineered glutamine for conjugation. Site-specific ADCs have comparable potency to randomly conjugated ADCs while exhibiting superior therapeutic index and pharmacokinetics. However, limitations exist in thiol-based coupling stability due to plasma hydrolysis of the succinimide ring of the thiomaleimide conjugate, resulting in drug transfer to serum albumin. Furthermore, the partial reduction and reformation of disulfide bonds that facilitates conjugation to the engineered free cysteine, can lead to aberrant disulfide-mediated quaternary structure. An alternative to using introduced free cysteine residues is to use site-specific incorporation of non-natural amino acids with chemical side chains that are compatible with bio-orthogonal conjugation chemistry.",
            "The essential componentry of any non-natural amino acid (nnAA) incorporation system consists of an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (aaRS) that charges a specific tRNA with a nnAA. The aaRS-tRNA pair must be orthogonal with respect to the host cell or expression system in which they are employed. That is, the nnAA-specific synthetase must not recognize any host tRNAs or cognate amino acids, and the tRNA must not be aminoacylated by any host aaRS. Additionally, the orthogonal tRNA anticodon is often mutated to recognize a stop or nonsense codon. Repurposing of non-proteinogenic codons, such as the amber stop codon TAG, enables incorporation of a nnAA at any site in a protein through mutagenesis of the mRNA coding sequence to TAG. Amber suppression is the most widely used mode of co-translational, enzyme catalyzed nnAA incorporation. Non-natural amino acids with bio-orthogonal reactive chemical side chains can be used as a chemical \u201chandle\u201d to conjugate various payloads to discrete sites in a protein. This approach can generate additional functionality to proteins by direct conjugation of biologically active adduct, such as fluorescent or radioactive labels, photoactivatable markers, pharmacokinetic modifying PEGs, or chemotherapeutic agents. Unfortunately, the current methods for nnAA incorporation and conjugation of bio-orthogonal reactive chemical side chains into proteins are hindered by low overall product yield, nnAA incorporation inefficiency and low conjugation efficiency.",

            "Therapeutic nucleic acids include, e.g., small interfering RNA (siRNA), micro RNA (miRNA), antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, plasmids, immune stimulating nucleic acids, antisense, antagomir, antimir, microRNA mimic, supermir, U1 adaptor, and aptamer. These nucleic acids act via a variety of mechanisms. In the case of siRNA or miRNA, these nucleic acids can down-regulate intracellular levels of specific proteins through a process termed RNA interference (RNAi). Following introduction of siRNA or miRNA into the cell cytoplasm, these double-stranded RNA constructs can bind to a protein termed RISC. The sense strand of the siRNA or miRNA is displaced from the RISC complex providing a template within RISC that can recognize and bind mRNA with a complementary sequence to that of the bound siRNA or miRNA. Having bound the complementary mRNA the RISC complex cleaves the mRNA and releases the cleaved strands. RNAi can provide down-regulation of specific proteins by targeting specific destruction of the corresponding mRNA that encodes for protein synthesis.",
            "The therapeutic applications of RNAi are extremely broad, since siRNA and miRNA constructs can be synthesized with any nucleotide sequence directed against a target protein. To date, siRNA constructs have shown the ability to specifically down-regulate target proteins in both in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, siRNA constructs are currently being evaluated in clinical studies.",
            "However, two problems currently faced by siRNA or miRNA constructs are, first, their susceptibility to nuclease digestion in plasma and, second, their limited ability to gain access to the intracellular compartment where they can bind RISC when administered systemically as the free siRNA or miRNA. These double-stranded constructs can be stabilized by incorporation of chemically modified nucleotide linkers within the molecule, for example, phosphothioate groups. However, these chemical modifications provide only limited protection from nuclease digestion and may decrease the activity of the construct. Intracellular delivery of siRNA or miRNA can be facilitated by use of carrier systems such as polymers, cationic liposomes or by chemical modification of the construct, for example by the covalent attachment of cholesterol molecules. However, improved delivery systems are required to increase the potency of siRNA and miRNA molecules and reduce or eliminate the requirement for chemical modification.",
            "Antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes can also inhibit mRNA translation into protein. In the case of antisense constructs, these single stranded deoxynucleic acids have a complementary sequence to that of the target protein mRNA and can bind to the mRNA by Watson-Crick base pairing. This binding either prevents translation of the target mRNA and/or triggers RNase H degradation of the mRNA transcripts. Consequently, antisense oligonucleotides have tremendous potential for specificity of action (i.e., down-regulation of a specific disease-related protein). To date, these compounds have shown promise in several in vitro and in vivo models, including models of inflammatory disease, cancer, and HIV (reviewed in Agrawal,  14:376-387 (1996)). Antisense can also affect cellular activity by hybridizing specifically with chromosomal DNA. Advanced human clinical assessments of several antisense drugs are currently underway. Targets for these drugs include the bcl2 and apolipoprotein B genes and mRNA products.",
            "Immune-stimulating nucleic acids include deoxyribonucleic acids and ribonucleic acids. In the case of deoxyribonucleic acids, certain sequences or motifs have been shown to illicit immune stimulation in mammals. These sequences or motifs include the CpG motif, pyrimidine-rich sequences and palindromic sequences. It is believed that the CpG motif in deoxyribonucleic acids is specifically recognized by an endosomal receptor, toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9), which then triggers both the innate and acquired immune stimulation pathway. Certain immune stimulating ribonucleic acid sequences have also been reported. It is believed that these RNA sequences trigger immune activation by binding to toll-like receptors 6 and 7 (TLR-6 and TLR-7). In addition, double-stranded RNA is also reported to be immune stimulating and is believe to activate via binding to TLR-3.",
            "One well known problem with the use of therapeutic nucleic acids relates to the stability of the phosphodiester internucleotide linkage and the susceptibility of this linker to nucleases. The presence of exonucleases and endonucleases in serum results in the rapid digestion of nucleic acids possessing phosphodiester linkers and, hence, therapeutic nucleic acids can have very short half-lives in the presence of serum or within cells. (Zelphati, O., et al.,  3:323-338 (1993); and Thierry, A. R., et al., pp 147-161 in Gene Regulation: Biology of Antisense RNA and DNA (Eds. Erickson, R P and Izant, J G; Raven Press, NY (1992)). Therapeutic nucleic acid being currently being developed do not employ the basic phosphodiester chemistry found in natural nucleic acids, because of these and other known problems.",
            "This problem has been partially overcome by chemical modifications that reduce serum or intracellular degradation. Modifications have been tested at the internucleotide phosphodiester bridge (e.g., using phosphorothioate, methylphosphonate or phosphoramidate linkages), at the nucleotide base (e.g., 5-propynyl-pyrimidines), or at the sugar (e.g., 2\u2032-modified sugars) (Uhlmann E., et al. Antisense: Chemical Modifications. Encyclopedia of Cancer, Vol. X., pp 64-81 Academic Press Inc. (1997)). Others have attempted to improve stability using 2\u2032-5\u2032 sugar linkages (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,532,130). Other changes have been attempted. However, none of these solutions have proven entirely satisfactory, and in vivo free therapeutic nucleic acids still have only limited efficacy.",
            "In addition, as noted above relating to siRNA and miRNA, problems remain with the limited ability of therapeutic nucleic acids to cross cellular membranes (see, Vlassov, et al.,  1197:95-1082 (1994)) and in the problems associated with systemic toxicity, such as complement-mediated anaphylaxis, altered coagulatory properties, and cytopenia (Galbraith, et al.,  4:201-206 (1994)).",
            "To attempt to improve efficacy, investigators have also employed lipid-based carrier systems to deliver chemically modified or unmodified therapeutic nucleic acids. In Zelphati, O and Szoka, F. C.,  41:99-119 (1996), the authors refer to the use of anionic (conventional) liposomes, pH sensitive liposomes, immunoliposomes, fusogenic liposomes, and cationic lipid/antisense aggregates. Similarly siRNA has been administered systemically in cationic liposomes, and these nucleic acid-lipid particles have been reported to provide improved down-regulation of target proteins in mammals including non-human primates (Zimmermann et al.,  441: 111-114 (2006)).",
            "In spite of this progress, there remains a need in the art for improved lipid-therapeutic nucleic acid compositions that are suitable for general therapeutic use. Preferably, these compositions would encapsulate nucleic acids with high-efficiency, have high drug:lipid ratios, protect the encapsulated nucleic acid from degradation and clearance in serum, be suitable for systemic delivery, and provide intracellular delivery of the encapsulated nucleic acid. In addition, these lipid-nucleic acid particles should be well-tolerated and provide an adequate therapeutic index, such that patient treatment at an effective dose of the nucleic acid is not associated with significant toxicity and/or risk to the patient. The present invention provides such compositions, methods of making the compositions, and methods of using the compositions to introduce nucleic acids into cells, including for the treatment of diseases."

            "BCMA plays an important role in regulating B-cell maturation and differentiation into plasma cells. It is closely related to BAFF receptor (BAFF-R) and transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI). While BCMA, BAFF-R, and TACI are type III transmembrane proteins that promote B-cell survival at distinct stages of development, BCMA is expressed exclusively in B-cell lineage cells, such as, for example, plasmablasts and differentiated plasma cells (Avery et al. (2003)  112(2):286-297; O'Connor et al. (2004)  199(1):91-98). It is selectively induced during plasma cell differentiation, which occurs concurrently with loss of BAFF-R expression in the differentiated cells (Darce et al. (2007)  178(9):5612-5622). BCMA expression appears to support the survival of normal plasma cells and plasmablasts but is typically absent on na\u00efve and most memory B cells. Thus, it does not appear to be needed for overall B-cell homeostasis but is required for optimal survival of long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow (O'Connor et al. (2004) supra; Xu, S. and K. P. Lam (2001)  21(12):4067-4074).",
            "In multiple myeloma, BCMA has been shown to be universally and widely expressed in malignant plasma cells at elevated levels; however, it is typically undetected on normal human tissues except for plasma cells. Due to its selective expression as a cell-surface receptor on multiple myeloma cell lines, BCMA can potentially be targeted in therapies to treat multiple myeloma. BCMA expression is also associated with leukemia and lymphoma. Accordingly, there is a need for improved methods of targeting and/or modulating the activity of BCMA. Given the specific expression of BCMA on plasma cells and lower expression in non-cancer tissue, there is a need for improved therapeutics that can specifically target cells and tissues that express or overexpress BCMA. Antibody conjugates to BCMA could be used to deliver therapeutic or diagnostic payload moieties to target cells expressing BCMA for the treatment or diagnosis of such diseases."

Once inside the cell, DNA must be transported into the nucleus where it is transcribed into RNA. The RNA transcribed from DNA must then enter the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. Not only do the multiple processing steps from administered DNA to protein create lag times before the generation of the functional protein, each step represents an opportunity for error and damage to the cell. Further, it is known to be difficult to obtain DNA expression in cells as DNA frequently enters a cell but is not expressed or not expressed at reasonable rates or concentrations. This can be a particular problem when DNA is introduced into primary cells or modified cell lines.",

There are seven known relaxin family peptides, including relaxin (RLN)1, RLN2, RLN3, and insulin-like peptide (INSL)3, INSL4, INSL5, INSL6, RLN1 and RLN2 are involved in collagen regulation and metabolism in fibroblasts, while RLN3 is specific to the brain. RLN1 and RLN2 are also involved in the hemodynamic changes that occur during pregnancy, including cardiac output, renal blood flow, and arterial compliance. Further, RLN2 mediates vasodilation through increased production of nitric oxide through a phosphorylation cascade. Relaxin is also a cardiac stimulant, and it can cause vasodilation through the inhibition of angiotensin II and endothelin, two potent vasoconstrictors. The hormone has also been shown to increase calcium sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments and increase phosphorylation of the myofilaments by protein kinase C.

Diseases associated with HHV-5 include mononucleosis and pneumonias. All herpesviruses share a characteristic ability to remain latent within the body over long periods of time. Although they may be found throughout the body, CMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands in humans and other mammals. Other CMV viruses are found in several mammal species, but species isolated from animals differ from HCMV in terms of genomic structure, and have not been reported to cause human disease.",
            "HCMV is endemic in most parts of the world. It is a ubiquitous large enveloped virus that infects 50 to 100% of the adult population worldwide. Although generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent hosts, HCMV infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised persons, such as infants following congenital or neonatal infections, transplant recipients, or AIDS patients.",
            "Primary infection normally results in subclinical disease after which the virus becomes latent, retaining the capacity to reactivate at a later time. The virus is transmitted through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk. In particular, individuals with undeveloped or compromised immunity are highly sensitive to infection by HCMV. It is estimated that at least 60% of the US population has been exposed to CMV, with a prevalence of more than 90% in high-risk groups (e.g., unborn babies whose mothers become infected with CMV during the pregnancy or people with HIV).",
            "In healthy individuals, HCMV typically causes an asymptomatic infection or produces mild, flulike symptoms. However, among two populations, HCMV is responsible for serious medical conditions. First, HCMV is a major cause of congenital defects in newborns infected in utero. Among congenitally infected newborns, 5-10% have major clinical symptoms at birth, such as microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, and hepatitis, as well as cytomegalic inclusion disease, which affects many tissues and organs including the central nervous system, liver, and retina and can lead to multi-organ failure and death. Other infants may be asymptomatic at birth, but later develop hearing loss or central nervous system abnormalities causing, in particular, poor intellectual performance and mental retardation. These pathologies are due in part to the ability of HCMV to enter and replicate in diverse cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, neurons, and monocytes/macrophages.",
            "The second population at risk are immunocompromised patients, such as those suffering from HIV infection and those undergoing transplantations. In this situation, the virus becomes an opportunistic pathogen and causes severe disease with high morbidity and mortality. The clinical disease causes a variety of symptoms including fever, pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, myelitis, colitis, uveitis, retinitis, and neuropathy. Rarer manifestations of HCMV infections in immunocompetent individuals include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, meningoencephalitis, pericarditis, myocarditis, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. Moreover, HCMV infection increases the risk of organ graft loss through transplant vascular sclerosis and restenosis, and may increase atherosclerosis in transplant patients as well as in the general population. It is estimated that HCMV infection causes clinical disease in 75% of patients in the first year after transplantation.",
            "There is currently no approved HCMV vaccine. Two candidate vaccines, Towne and gB/MF59, have completed phase II efficacy trials. The Towne vaccine appears protective against both infection and disease caused by challenge with pathogenic Toledo strain and also appears to be effective in preventing severe post-transplantation CMV disease. However, in a small phase II clinical trial, a low dose of Towne vaccine failed to show protection against infection of seronegative mothers who had children actively shedding CMV.",
            "The gB/MF59 vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine comprised of a transmembrane-deleted version of HCMV gB protein, which induces high levels of fibroblast entry neutralizing antibodies in humans and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in both adults and toddlers. A recent phase II double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the gB/MF59 vaccine revealed a 50% efficacy in inducing sterilizing immunity. As this vaccine induces potent antibody responses but very weak T-cell responses, the partial efficacy provided by the vaccine is thought to be primarily antibody-mediated. While this HCMV vaccine is the first to show any protective efficacy, its 50% protection falls short of the 80-90% desired for most vaccines.",
            "In addition, antibody therapy has been used to control HCMV infection in immunocompromised individuals and to reduce the pathological consequences of maternal-fetal transmission, although such therapy is usually not sufficient to eradicate the virus. HCMV immunoglobulins (Igs) have been administered to transplant patients in association with immunosuppressive treatments for prophylaxis of HCMV disease with mixed results. Antibody therapy has also been used to control brief infection and prevent disease in newborns. However, these products are plasma derivatives with relatively low potency and have to be administered by intravenous infusion at very high doses in order to deliver sufficient amounts of neutralizing antibodies.",
            "HCMV is the leading viral cause of neurodevelopmental abnormality and other birth defects in children and the costs to society are substantial. Although antiviral therapy is available, the treatment with antiviral agents is imperfect and development of a CMV vaccine is the most promising strategy for preventing CMV infection. Given that the health and economic benefits of effective HCMV vaccines are significant, the US Institute of Medicine and US National Vaccine Program Office has categorized development of a CMV vaccine as a highest priority, but no candidate vaccine is under consideration for licensure."

For example, heterologous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) introduced into a cell can be inherited by daughter cells (whether or not the heterologous DNA has integrated into the chromosome) or by offspring. Introduced DNA can integrate into host cell genomic DNA at some frequency, resulting in alterations and/or damage to the host cell genomic DNA. In addition, multiple steps must occur before a protein is made. Once inside the cell, DNA must be transported into the nucleus where it is transcribed into RNA. The RNA transcribed from DNA must then enter the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. This need for multiple processing steps creates lag times before the generation of a protein of interest. Further, it is difficult to obtain DNA expression in cells; frequently DNA enters cells but is not expressed or not expressed at reasonable rates or concentrations. This can be a particular problem when DNA is introduced into cells such as primary cells or modified cell lines.",

Current genome editing technologies utilizing the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) system introduce double-stranded DNA breaks at a target locus as the first step to gene correction. In response to double-stranded DNA breaks, cellular DNA repair processes mostly result in random insertions or deletions (indels) at the site of DNA cleavage through non-homologous end joining. Although most genetic diseases arise from point mutations, current approaches to point mutation correction are inefficient and typically induce an abundance of random insertions and deletions (indels) at the target locus resulting from the cellular response to dsDNA breaks. Therefore, there is a need for an improved form of genome editing that is more efficient and with far fewer undesired products such as stochastic insertions or deletions (indels) or translocations.",

In regions densely populated with both people and livestock, zoonotic diseases can spread very quickly. With changes in the environment, human behavior and habitat, increasingly these infections are emerging from wildlife species. Specific examples of zoonotic viruses include Lassa virus, Nipah virus, and betacoronaviruses.",
            "Lassa Virus. Lassa virus (LASV), a segmented negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the family Arenaviridae, is endemic to West Africa. Transmission typically occurs through contact with infected rodents or virus-contaminated rodent excreta, and person-to-person transmission. The LASV expresses just one protein on its surface, termed GPC, which mediates both attachment to and entry of host cells. GPC is a class I viral fusion protein that forms trimers on the viral surface. Each monomer in the trimer is assembled by distinct GP1 and GP2 subunits that mediate receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively. Notably, on the viral surface, GP2 is coiled about the base of GP1 in a structure that is only metastable. The complex is prone to rapid disassembly of GP1 from GP2 and rearrangement of the GP2 into a much more stable six-helix bundle. The release of energy achieved by collapsing of the metastable viral-surface conformation to the much more stable six-helix bundle conformation drives fusion of viral and host membranes during infection. Because of its metastability, it is difficult to maintain GPC on its trimeric pre-fusion configuration when expressed recombinantly or even when expressed on some particle surfaces. Antibodies against the resulting separated subunits are not potently neutralizing. As a result, prior vaccine approaches that included natural GPC failed to elicit an effective antibody response, leading vaccine manufacturers to instead focus on induction of cell-mediated immunity as the most likely correlate of protection. Further, in the absence of knowledge about how to create or purify stabilized Lassa virus GPC trimeric, vaccine makers did not have the necessary reagents to evaluate the most ideal antibody responses.",

After a ten-year effort in engineering LASV GPC, using the GOC to evaluate human antibody responses from survivors, several high-resolution three-dimensional structures of the Lassa virus GPC in complex with these antibodies have been identified.",

The epidemiology of MERS-CoV infection in humans remains unclear and convoluted with Bats and Dromedary Camels being the major reservoirs for the virus. As of June 2016, the World Health Organization has reported a total of 1,769 MERS-CoV infections with a mortality rate of 36% and an ongoing risk of human to human transmission.

            "Fabry disease is an X-linked inherited disorder that is caused by mutations in the \u03b1-galactosidase A (GLA) gene, which encodes an enzyme that is involved in recycling fats within the lysosomal compartments of cells. Fabry disease is also referred to as \u03b1-galactosidase A deficiency, Anderson-Fabry disease, angiokeratoma corporis diffusum, angiokeratoma diffuse, ceramide trihexosidase deficiency, Fabry's disease, GLA deficiency, and hereditary dystopic lipidosis. It has an estimated incidence of 1 in 40,000 to 400,000 males. Deegan et al., 2006  43(4):347-352.",
            "GLA, which is also referred to as GALA, is a homodimeric glycoprotein that hydrolyzes the terminal \u03b1-galactosyl moieties from glycolipids and glycoproteins. See, e.g., GenBank Accession Numbers NM_000169 for the GLA mRNA sequence and NP_000160 for the GLA amino acid sequence. The GLA precursor protein is 429 amino acids in length and contains a signal peptide of 31 amino acids that is cleaved during protein processing. Mutations in GLA lead to an accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3), galabiosylceramide (Ga2), and neutral glycosphingolipids in lysosomes of several tissues, including the endothelium of the vascular tree. Gervas-Arruga et al., 2015  16:109. While normal individuals have very low levels of Gb3, patients with Fabry disease progressively accumulate Gb3 in both plasma and a range of tissues.",
            "The classic form of Fabry disease usually manifests in childhood or adolescence with periodic crises of severe pain in the extremities (acroparesthesias), the appearance of vascular cutaneous lesions (angiokeratomas), sweating abnormalities (anhydrosis, hypohydosis, and rarely hyperhidrosis), characteristic corneal and lenticular opacities, and proteinuria. End-stage renal disease usually occurs in the third to fifth decade, and even those individuals successfully treated for renal disease usually suffer from cardiac or cerebrovascular disease. Mehta et al.  , University of Washington, Seattle (2013).",
            "Currently, treatment for Fabry disease typically consists of diphenylhydantoin, carbamazepine, or gabapentin to reduce pain; ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers to reduce proteinuria; and chronic hemodialysis and/or renal transplantation to treat renal disease. Enzyme replacement therapy is also often recommended, but its effectiveness is unproven. Mehta et al.  , University of Washington, Seattle (2013). Improved therapeutics and therapies are thus needed to treat Fabry disease."

Commercially-available oligo dT resins are predominantly kit-based and are typically utilized for small scale (<1 mg) mRNA isolations on a bench top from crude cell/tissue extracts or blood. Commercially-available matrices typically consist of cellulose, latex particles, and magnetic beads containing dT ligands. These options are not generally viable for large scale chromatographic processes for cGMP manufacture of therapeutic mRNAs. In particular, cellulose resin produces significant quantities of leached ligand, contains significant amounts of fine particulates, and has poor flow properties; making it less than ideal for column chromatography. In terms of RNA quality and purity, commercially-available, cellulose based media has been found to yield eluted PolyA containing RNA with substantial endotoxin contamination as well as considerable enzyme and DNA template carryover and contamination. RNA produced using this commercially-available cellulose resin must generally be coupled with additional separation procedures to ensure RNA is of acceptable quality for pre-clinical studies and therapeutic use. Endotoxin contamination is detrimental to patient safety and therefore a process that introduces endotoxin into a drug substance is generally not viable for use in patients."

The present application further relates to a method of treating cancer by combining anti-cancer immunotherapy with the administration of the aforementioned mRNA cancer vaccine.",
        "paragraph": [
            "Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapies) have demonstrated that powerful anti-tumor responses can be achieved by activating large numbers of T cells in a variety of cancer settings. Several checkpoint inhibitor biologic agents (e.g., anti-CTLA-4 [anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4], anti-PD-1 [anti-programmed cell death protein 1], and anti-PD-L1 [anti-programmed death-ligand 1]) are currently approved for human use in several cancer types, including metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma and bladder carcinoma. These inhibitory receptors and their ligands play complementary roles in down-regulating adaptive immunity; PD-1/PD-L1 contributes to T cell exhaustion in peripheral tissues, and CTLA-4 inhibits earlier T cell activation events (Sharma and Allison 2015). Though it is clear that single agent checkpoint inhibitor therapy can provide significant benefit for some patients, many patients have incomplete or no response to therapy presenting a clear unmet need.",
            "As tumors grow they acquire mutations, some of which create neoantigens that correlate with improved patient responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Several recent studies have shown the relevance of T-cell recognition of neoantigens in patients who respond to checkpoint blockade. Accumulating evidence suggests that checkpoint inhibitor efficacy is driven by blocking the negative signals generated by engagement of inhibitory receptors on T cells with their ligands on tumors and other immune cells, especially antigen presenting cells. The loss of inhibition following checkpoint blockade allows the patients' T cells to recognize neoantigens as foreign and this enhanced recognition leads to T-cell-mediated destruction of the tumor cells."

Precise genome targeting technologies are needed to enable systematic reverse engineering of causal genetic variations by allowing selective perturbation of individual genetic elements, as well as to advance synthetic biology, biotechnological, and medical applications.",
            "Gene editing using site-specific nucleases has emerged as a technology for both basic biomedical research and therapeutic development. Various platforms based on four major types of endonucleases have been developed for gene editing, namely meganucleases and their derivatives, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) associated endonuclease 9 (Cas9). Each nuclease type is capable of inducing a DNA double-stranded break (DSB) at specific DNA loci, thus triggering two DNA repair pathways. The non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway generates random insertion/deletion (indel) mutations at the DSB, whereas the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway repairs the DSB with the genetic information carried on a donor template. Therefore, these gene editing platforms are useful for manipulating genes at specific genomic loci in multiple ways, such as disrupting gene function, repairing a mutant gene to a wild type, and inserting new DNA sequences.",
            "Although these genome-editing techniques have been developed for producing targeted genome modifications, there remains a need for new genome gene editing platforms that are capable of manipulating genes at specific genomic loci in multiple ways, such as disrupting gene function, repairing a mutant gene to produce a wild type product, and/or inserting heterologous DNA material at specific loci within the genome of a target cell, for example, for use in the treatment of diseases, such as monogenic diseases (e.g., hemophilia A).",
            "Hemophilia A (Hem A) is caused by a genetic defect in the Factor VIII (FVIII) gene that results in low or undetectable levels of FVIII protein in the blood. This results in ineffective clot formation at sites of tissue injury leading to uncontrolled bleeding that can be fatal if not treated. Replacement of the missing or nonfunctional FVIII protein is the current standard of care. However, protein replacement therapy requires frequent administration of FVIII protein, which is inconvenient in adults, problematic in children, cost prohibitive (>$200,000/year), and can result in breakthrough bleeding events if the treatment regimen is not closely followed.",
            "The FVIII gene (also referred to as F8) is expressed primarily in sinusoidal endothelial cells that are present in the liver as well as other sites in the body. Gene delivery methods have been developed that target the hepatocytes and these methods have been used to deliver a FVIII gene as a treatment for Hem A both in animal models and in patients in clinical trials.",
            "Despite progress with gene therapy, which is exclusively virus-based using Adeno Associated Virus (AAV), the methods have disadvantages. For example, reported AAV-based gene therapy uses a FVIII gene driven by a liver specific promoter that is encapsulated inside an AAV virus capsid (for example, using the serotypes AAV5, AAV8, AAV3b, or AAV9 or AAVhu37). In general, AAV viruses used for gene therapy deliver the packaged gene cassette into the nucleus of the transduced cells where the gene cassette remains almost exclusively extra-chromosomal and it is the extra-chromosomal copies of the therapeutic gene that give rise to the therapeutic protein. AAV does not have a mechanism to integrate the encapsulated DNA into the genome of the host cells. Instead because the therapeutic gene is maintained largely as an extra-chromosomal episome, the therapeutic gene is not replicated when the host cell divides. Furthermore, the therapeutic DNA can be subject to degradation over time. It has been demonstrated that when liver cells containing AAV episomes are induced to divide, the AAV genome is not replicated but is instead diluted (Grimm et al. 206, J Virol 80, 426-439; Colella et al. 2018, Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev 8, 87-104). As a result, AAV based gene therapy is not expected to be effective when used to treat children whose livers have not yet achieved adult size. Therefore, there is a critical need for developing new effective and permeant treatments for Hem A."

For example, introduced DNA can integrate into host cell genomic DNA at some frequency, resulting in alterations and/or damage to the host cell genomic DNA.

            "In addition, assuming proper delivery and no damage or integration into the host genome, there are multiple steps which must occur before the encoded protein is made. Once inside the cell, DNA must be transported into the nucleus where it is transcribed into RNA. The RNA transcribed from DNA must then enter the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. Not only do the multiple processing steps from administered DNA to protein create lag times before the generation of the functional protein, each step represents an opportunity for error and damage to the cell. Further, it is known to be difficult to obtain DNA expression in cells as DNA frequently enters a cell but is not expressed or not expressed at reasonable rates or concentrations. This can be a particular problem when DNA is introduced into primary cells or modified cell lines.",

The most studied genus is human cytomegalovirus, also known as human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), which is widely distributed in the human population. Diseases associated with HHV-5 include mononucleosis and pneumonias. All herpesviruses share a characteristic ability to remain latent within the body over long periods of time. Although they may be found throughout the body, CMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands in humans and other mammals. Other CMV viruses are found in several mammal species, but species isolated from animals differ from HCMV in terms of genomic structure, and have not been reported to cause human disease.",

The virus is transmitted through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk. In particular, individuals with undeveloped or compromised immunity are highly sensitive to infection by HCMV. It is estimated that at least 60% of the US population has been exposed to CMV, with a prevalence of more than 90% in high-risk groups (e.g., unborn babies whose mothers become infected with CMV during the pregnancy or people with HIV).",
            "In healthy individuals, HCMV typically causes an asymptomatic infection or produces mild, flulike symptoms. However, among two populations, HCMV is responsible for serious medical conditions. First, HCMV is a major cause of congenital defects in newborns infected in utero. Among congenitally infected newborns, 5-10% have major clinical symptoms at birth, such as microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, and hepatitis, as well as cytomegalic inclusion disease, which affects many tissues and organs including the central nervous system, liver, and retina and can lead to multi-organ failure and death. Other infants may be asymptomatic at birth, but later develop hearing loss or central nervous system abnormalities causing, in particular, poor intellectual performance and mental retardation. These pathologies are due in part to the ability of HCMV to enter and replicate in diverse cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, neurons, and monocytes/macrophages.",
            "The second population at risk are immunocompromised patients, such as those suffering from HIV infection and those undergoing transplantations. In this situation, the virus becomes an opportunistic pathogen and causes severe disease with high morbidity and mortality. The clinical disease causes a variety of symptoms including fever, pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, myelitis, colitis, uveitis, retinitis, and neuropathy. Rarer manifestations of HCMV infections in immunocompetent individuals include Guillain-Barre syndrome, meningoencephalitis, pericarditis, myocarditis, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. Moreover, HCMV infection increases the risk of organ graft loss through transplant vascular sclerosis and restenosis, and may increase atherosclerosis in transplant patients as well as in the general population. It is estimated that HCMV infection causes clinical disease in 75% of patients in the first year after transplantation.",
            "There is currently no approved HCMV vaccine. Two candidate vaccines, Towne and gB/MF59, have completed phase II efficacy trials. The Towne vaccine appears protective against both infection and disease caused by challenge with pathogenic Toledo strain and also appears to be effective in preventing severe post-transplantation CMV disease. However, in a small phase II clinical trial, a low dose of Towne vaccine failed to show protection against infection of seronegative mothers who had children actively shedding CMV.",
            "The gB/MF59 vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine comprised of a transmembrane-deleted version of HCMV gB protein, which induces high levels of fibroblast entry neutralizing antibodies in humans and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in both adults and toddlers. A recent phase II double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the gB/MF59 vaccine revealed a 50% efficacy in inducing sterilizing immunity. As this vaccine induces potent antibody responses but very weak T-cell responses, the partial efficacy provided by the vaccine is thought to be primarily antibody-mediated. While this HCMV vaccine is the first to show any protective efficacy, its 50% protection falls short of the 80-90% desired for most vaccines.",
            "In addition, antibody therapy has been used to control HCMV infection in immunocompromised individuals and to reduce the pathological consequences of maternal-fetal transmission, although such therapy is usually not sufficient to eradicate the virus. HCMV immunoglobulins (Igs) have been administered to transplant patients in association with immunosuppressive treatments for prophylaxis of HCMV disease with mixed results. Antibody therapy has also been used to control brief infection and prevent disease in newborns. However, these products are plasma derivatives with relatively low potency and have to be administered by intravenous infusion at very high doses in order to deliver sufficient amounts of neutralizing antibodies.",
            "HCMV is the leading viral cause of neurodevelopmental abnormality and other birth defects in children and the costs to society are substantial. Although antiviral therapy is available, the treatment with antiviral agents is imperfect and development of a CMV vaccine is the most promising strategy for preventing CMV infection. Given that the health and economic benefits of effective HCMV vaccines are significant, the US Institute of Medicine and US National Vaccine Program Office has categorized development of a CMV vaccine as a highest priority, but no candidate vaccine is under consideration for licensure."

Relaxin facilitates angiogenesis and contributes to the repair of vascular endothelium. It exerts its effects on the musculoskeletal and other systems through binding its receptor in different tissues, a process mediated by different signaling pathways. There are seven known relaxin family peptides, including relaxin (RLN)1, RLN2, RLN3, and insulin-like peptide (INSL)3, INSL4, INSL5, INSL6. RLN1 and RLN2 are involved in collagen regulation and metabolism in fibroblasts, while RLN3 is specific to the brain. RLN1 and RLN2 are also involved in the hemodynamic changes that occur during pregnancy, including cardiac output, renal blood flow, and arterial compliance. Further, RLN2 mediates vasodilation through increased production of nitric oxide through a phosphorylation cascade. Relaxin is also a cardiac stimulant, and it can cause vasodilation through the inhibition of angiotensin II and endothelin, two potent vasoconstrictors. The hormone has also been shown to increase calcium sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments and increase phosphorylation of the myofilaments by protein kinase C. The force generated by the myofilaments increases while the energy consumption of the cardiac myocytes does not. In the kidneys, relaxin increases creatinine clearance and increases renal blood flow.",

A recombinant form of relaxin referred to as Serelaxin and marketed by Novartis, has been demonstrated to have low toxicity, however, the efficacy has been questionable because it is degraded so quickly in the bloodstream. Serelaxin has a half-life of about 15 minutes in serum and 7-8 hours during continuous 48 hour infusion."

Problems in the IVT reaction can result in complete failure (e.g., no transcript generated) or in transcripts that are the incorrect size (e.g., shorter or longer than expected). Specific problems associated with IVT reactions include, for example, abortive (truncated) transcripts, run-on transcripts, polyA tail variants/3\u2032 heterogeneity, mutated transcripts, and/or double-stranded contaminants produced during the reactions.",
            "RNA polymerases exhibit three phases of transcription\u2014initiation, elongation and termination. During the initiation phase, the RNA polymerase binds to a specific promoter DNA sequence, opens the DNA duplex and feeds the template strand into the active site. T7 RNA polymerase, for example, forms a structure referred to as initiation complex, which includes a six-helix bundle sub-domain (the promoter binding domain) that interacts with the promoter to initiate DNA duplex melting. While bound to the promoter, the polymerase produces many short (truncated) transcripts from 2-12 nucleotides (nt) in length, a process often referred to as abortive synthesis/initiation. The truncated RNA transcripts cannot be converted to full-length transcripts by RNA polymerase and become by-products that accumulate during transcription. After the transition to the elongation phase and release of the promoter, the polymerase proceeds down the DNA template producing a full-length RNA transcript.",
            "During the elongation phase, RNA polymerase often continues to transcribe DNA beyond the point at which termination should be initiated, generating longer than expected RNA transcripts (\u201crun-on transcripts\u201d).

Studies suggest that more than 70% of transcripts generated by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro may be run-on transcripts.

            "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism that results from a deficiency in the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). This disease is found in all ethnic groups and its incidence varies widely around the world with the highest incidence being in Northern Europe. PKU is mainly caused by mutations in the PAH gene that results in decreased catalytic activity affecting the catabolic pathway of phenylalanine (Phe). The PAH enzyme requires the activity of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH ) in order to convert Phe to tyrosine (Tyr). A deficiency in either PAH or its cofactor, results in the accumulation of excess phenylalanine. This can result in severe and irreversible intellectual disability if left untreated. Other clinical features associated with untreated PKU include autistic behaviors, motor deficits, eczematous rash, and seizures. Behavioral impairment as well as psychiatric disturbances generally become apparent with age.",
            "Currently, there is no cure for PKU. The prevailing treatment is mainly through dietary restriction of Phe to the minimum required for normal growth, supplemented with specifically designed medical foods. However, there are at least four major issues with current dietary treatment: (i) dietary compliance due to unpalatability of the diet; (ii) persisting neurological or psychosocial issues and poor quality of life despite early intervention; (iii) potential nutritional deficiencies resulting from restrictive diet; and (iv) financial burden due to the cost of special medical food and dietary supplements.",
            "For a subset of patients with hyperphenylalaninemia that have mutations in the cofactor BH , a synthetic analogue of BH called sapropterin is typically used for treatment. One can distinguish between PKU caused by a defect in PAH versus a defect in BH by a BH loading test. While treatment with synthetic biopterin compounds or sapropterin are generally successful in BH -responsive PKU patients, for about 90% of patients with classical PKU, who comprise about 50-80% of patients detected by newborn screening (PAHdb; pandb.mcgill.ca), BH therapy has no beneficial effects.",
            "Gene therapy by targeting a functional recombinant PAH gene to the liver using viral vectors including adenoviral and adeno-associated viral vectors have been tested for the ability to correct PKU in mouse models or to correct cultured hepatocytes derived from these mouse models. Within one week, complete normalization of the serum phenylalanine levels was achieved in PKU mice; however, the therapeutic effect of the adenoviral vector ceased after a few weeks and repeated administration did not recapitulate the original results due to development of an immune response. Another study showed that a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector carrying the mouse PAH cDNA delivered to the liver by portal vein injection reduced blood Phe levels in PKU mice; however, this reduction was only noted in male PKU mice. Three times more vector was needed for female PKU mice to achieve an equivalent reduction in serum Phe levels as that seen in male mice. Furthermore, correction did not persist beyond 40 weeks with blood Phe returning to pretreatment levels.",
            "Another approach to treating PKU has been to use enzyme therapy by employing PAH-based fusion proteins to specifically target PAH to the liver. A decrease in plasma Phe levels for several hours after intravenous administration in mice treated with PAH-based fusion proteins was observed. However, it is likely that multiple frequent injections would be required, making this approach less practical from a clinical perspective.",
            "Yet another approach for treating PKU has been by enzyme substitution therapy by using PAL (E.C.4.3.1.5). PAL is an enzyme found in higher plants and yeast that catalyzes the conversion of Phe to transcinnamic acid and insignificant amounts of ammonia. Unlike the mammalian enzyme (PAH), PAL is a monomer and requires no cofactors. Despite the advancement of a PAL formulation into phase III clinical trials, pre-clinical studies indicate that weekly injections are required to sustain a significant decrease in the Phe levels in the PKU mice for up to one year. Also, response to PAL dosing regimens was gender-dependent in mouse models, similar to what was observed in mice undergoing genome-targeted PAH gene therapy. Although PAL therapy reduced Phe levels and reversed PKU induced hypopigmentation in mice, repeated injections of this agent would be invasive and burdensome to the patients and their families. In fact, there have been reports of adverse immune reactions. Moreover, physiological stress, pain, inconvenience, cost, and risks of infection are associated with repeated injections.",

First, the antigen is generated through culturing viruses in cell lines, growing bacteria in bioreactors, or producing recombinant proteins derived from viruses and bacteria in cell cultures, yeast or bacteria. Recombinant proteins are then purified and the viruses and bacteria are inactivated before they are formulated with adjuvants in vaccines. It has been a challenge to drastically reduce the time and expense associated with current technologies in vaccine development.",

In contrast, bacteria acquire and mutate key proteins to evade host defense and effective antibiotic applications.",

The rapid evolution of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the influenza virus results in the constant emergence of new strains, rendering the adaptive immune response of the host only partially protective to new infections. The biggest challenge for therapy and prophylaxis against influenza and other infections using traditional vaccines is the limitation of vaccines in breadth, providing protection only against closely related subtypes. In addition, today's length of the production process inhibits any fast reaction to develop and produce an adapted vaccine in a pandemic situation.",

The perpetual or aberrant circulation and proliferation of such molecules and entities can drive disease and/or exacerbate existing conditions.",
            "The efficacy of therapeutic compositions that alleviate or prevent diseases and conditions associated with the circulatory system is often limited by their half-life, which is typically up to a few days. The short half-life often necessitates repeated injections and hospitalizations. It is thought that the short half-life may be due to both renal clearance, e.g., of proteins smaller than 60 kDa, and non-renal clearance, e.g., via liver excretion or immune-mediated removal. The activity of therapies is also often limited by an immune reaction elicited against them (see, e.g., Wang et al., Leukemia 2003, 17:1583). Several approaches are practiced in the art.",
            "One approach includes the use of \u201cerythrocyte ghosts\u201d that are derived from a hemolyzed red blood cell. To prepare erythrocyte ghosts, red blood cells undergo hypotonic lysis. The red blood cells are exposed to low ionic strength buffer causing them to burst. The resulting lysed cell membranes are isolated by centrifugation. The pellet of lysed red blood cell membranes is resuspended and incubated in the presence of the therapeutic agent, for example, such as an antibiotic or chemotherapeutic agent in a low ionic strength buffer. The therapeutic agent distributes within the cells. Erythrocyte ghosts and derivatives used to encapsulate payloads, such as therapeutic agents, can shield those payloads from the immune system, but the erythrocyte ghosts themselves are subject to rapid clearance by the reticulo-endothelial system (see, e.g., Loegering et al. 1987 Infect Immun 55(9):2074). Erythrocyte ghosts also elicit an immune response in mammalian subjects. These vesicles are typically constituted of both lipids and proteins, including potentially high amounts of phosphatidylserine, which is normally found on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This leads to potential immunological reactions in the recipient mammalian subjects. The undesirable effects seriously limit the potential for therapeutic applications of technologies based on erythrocyte ghosts.",
            "Another approach for drug encapsulation includes the use of exosomes. \u201cExosomes\u201d include cell-derived vesicles that are present in many and perhaps all biological fluids, including blood, urine, and cultured medium of cell cultures. The reported diameter of exosomes is between 30 and 100 nm, which is larger than low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but smaller than, for example, red blood cells. Exosomes are either released from the cell when multivesicular bodies fuse with the plasma membrane or they are released directly from the plasma membrane. Exosome delivery methods require a better understanding of their biology, as well as the development of production, characterization, targeting and cargo-loading nanotechnologies. Attempts have been made to manufacture exosomes using human embryonic stem cell derived mesenchymal stem cells (hESC-MSCs). However, as hESC-MSCs are not infinitely expansible, large scale production of exosomes would require replenishment of hESC-MSC through derivation from hESCs and incur recurring costs for testing and validation of each new batch (Chen et al. 2011 Journal of Translational Medicine 9:47). Clinical translation is also hindered by the lack of suitable and scalable nanotechnologies for the purification and loading of exosomes (Lakhal and Wood 2011 BioEssays 33(10):737). Current ultracentrifugation protocols are commercially unreproducible, as they produce a heterogeneous mix of exosomes, other cellular vesicles and macromolecular complexes. Therefore, purification methods based on the use of specific, desired markers, such as the expression of a targeting moiety on the surface of the exosome, are required. In addition, siRNA loading into exosomes is relatively inefficient and cost-ineffective, highlighting the need for the development of transfection reagents tailored for nanoparticle applications. Further, exosomes are rapidly cleared from circulation and substantially accumulate in the liver within 24 hours of administration (Ohno et al., 2013 Mol Therapy 21(1):185), limiting their application for long-term drug delivery to the circulatory of a subject.",
            "Polyethylene glycol-coated liposomes are presently used as carriers for in vivo drug delivery. A \u201cliposome\u201d includes an artificially-prepared spherical vesicle composed of a lamellar phase lipid bilayer. The liposome can be used as a vehicle for administration of nutrients and pharmaceutical agents. Liposomes can be prepared by disrupting biological membranes, e.g., by sonication. Liposomes are often composed of phosphatidylcholine-enriched phospholipids and may also contain mixed lipid chains with surfactant properties such as egg phosphatidylethanolamine. A liposome design may employ surface ligands for attaching to a target, e.g., unhealthy tissue. Types of liposomes include the multilamellar vesicle (MLV), the small unilamellar liposome vesicle (SUV), the large unilamellar vesicle (LUV), and the cochleate vesicle. Liposomes as cariers of anthracycline antibiotics have been a subject of a great number of studies. As a result, liposome formulations of daunorubicin (DaunoXome\u2122) and doxorubicin (Doxil\u2122) are now commercially available. The pharmacokinetics of the liposomal forms of anthracycline antibiotics differ from that of their free forms in higher peak concentrations and longer circulations times of the drugs. The kinetics of DaunoXome and Doxil clearance from plasma is close to mono-exponential. The half-life of DaumoXome in patient plasma is on the order of a few hours. In Doxil, polyethylene glycol-coated liposomes are used. The immune system poorly recognizes such liposomes; therefore the plasma half-life of Doxil is in the order of tens of hours.",
            "Red blood cells have been considered for use, e.g., to degrade toxic metabolites or inactivate xenobiotics, as drug delivery systems, as carriers of antigens for vaccination, and in other biomedical applications (Magnani Ed. 2003, Erythrocyte Engineering for Drug Delivery and Targeting). Many of these applications require procedures for the transient opening of pores across the red cell membrane. Drugs have commonly been loaded into freshly isolated red blood cells, without culturing, using disruptive methods based on hypotonic shock. Hypotonic dialysis can induce a high degree of hemolysis, irreversible modifications in the morphology of the cells and phosphotidyl serine exposure, which has been recognized as an important parameter associated with premature red blood cells removal and induction of transfusion-related pathologies (Favretto 2013 J Contr Rel).",
            "Many drugs, particularly protein therapeutics, stimulate immunogenic responses that include B cell antibody production, T cell activation, and macrophage phagocytosis. The causes of immunogenicity can be extrinsic or intrinsic to the protein. Extrinsic factors are drug formulation, aggregate formation, degradation products, contaminants and dosing. The administration mode, as well as the drug regimen, also strongly influences how immunogenicity is assessed. That is, immunogenicity will have different effects for drugs that are given in acute indications compared to drugs to treat chronic diseases. In the latter case, patients are exposed to the drug over a longer period of time and as such can mount a complete response. Pegylation is a technology designed to prolong the half-life, as well as minimize immunogenic responses. In contrast to assumptions that polyethylene glycol (PEG) is non-immunogenic and non-antigenic, certain animal studies show that uricase, ovalbumin and some other PEGylated agents can elicit antibody formation against PEG (anti-PEG). In humans, anti-PEG may limit therapeutic efficacy and/or reduce tolerance of PEG-asparaginase (PEG-ASNase) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and of pegloticase in patients with chronic gout, but did not impair hyposensitization of allergic patients with mPEG-modified ragweed extract or honeybee venom or the response to PEG-IFN in patients with hepatitis C. Anti-PEG antibodies can be found in 22-25% of healthy blood donors. Two decades earlier, the occurrence was 0.2%. This increase may be due to an improvement of the limit of detection of antibodies and to greater exposure to PEG and PEG-containing compounds in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and processed food products. These results raise concerns regarding the efficacy of PEG-conjugated drugs for a subset of patients (Garay, Expert Opin Drug Deliv, 2012 9(11):1319).",
            "Attempts in the art to create passive half-life improvement methods focus on increasing the apparent hydrodynamic radius of a drug. The kidney's glomerular filtration apparatus is the primary site in the body where blood components are filtered, see for reference e.g., Osicka et al. Clin Sci 1997 93:65 and Myers et al. Kidney Int 1982 21:633. The main determinant of filtration is the hydrodynamic radius of the molecule in the blood; smaller molecules (<80 kDa) are filtered out of the blood to a higher extent than larger molecules. Researchers have used this generalized rule to modify drugs to exhibit a larger hydrodynamic radius and thus longer half-life, mainly via chemical conjugation to large molecular weight water-soluble polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). Numerous PEGylated protein and small molecule therapeutics are currently offered in the clinic (Pasut and Veronese, 2009 Adv Drug Deliv Rev 61(13):1177; Fishburn, 2008 J Pharm Sci 97(10):4167). Though effective in many cases in increasing circulation half-life, especially as the hydrodynamic radius of the graft or fusion increases (Gao, Liu, et al., 2009 PNAS 106(36):15231), these methods offer challenges in manufacturing and maintenance of biological effector function. Heterogeneities in conjugation reactions can cause complex product mixtures with varying biological activities, due mostly to the utilization of site-unspecific chemistries. Extensive biochemical characterization often follows precise purification methods to retain a homogenous therapeutic product (Huang, Gough, et al, 2009 Anal Chem 81(2):567; Bailon, Palleroni, et al., 2001 Bioconj Chem 12(2):195; Dhalluin, Ross, et al., 2005 Bioconj Chem 16(3):504). Furthermore, attachment of large moieties, such as branched PEGs, to reactive zones of proteins can lead to decreased receptor affinity (Fishburn, 2008 J Pharm Sci 97(10):4167).",
            "Albumin may be used to bind a therapeutic protein for increased circulation of the drug (Dennis et al, 2002 J Bil Chem 277(38):35035; Walker, Dunlevy, et al., 2010 Prot Engr Des Sel 23(4):271) to increase the apparent size of the therapeutic by engineering it to bind another protein in the blood. In this manner, the drug attains its large molecular size only after administration into the blood stream. The addition of affinity-matured serum albumin-binding peptides to antibody fragments increased their circulation time 24 fold in mice (Dennis et al, 2002 J Bil Chem 277(38):35035). This method is complicated by the dynamics of albumin recycle by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and the use of cysteine-constrained cyclic peptides for functionality. Alternatively, recombinant addition of large antibody fragments may be made to a protein drug. This may cause structural as well as manufacturing complications, e.g., because of the use of complex cyclic or large domains for functionality. Despite high affinity for albumin, they require the physical constraint of correctly forming a cyclic structure prior to use. Methods of fusing larger antibody fragments may not be amendable to proteins with an already complex folding structure or low expression yield.",
            "The potential of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, antibody-coupled T-cell receptor (ACTR) therapies and other adoptive T-cell therapies in effecting complete and durable responses has been demonstrated in a number of malignant and infectious diseases. The development of more potent T cells is limited, however, by safety concerns, highlighted by the occurrence of on-target and off-target toxicities that, although uncommon, have been fatal on occasions. Timely pharmacological intervention can be effective in the management of adverse events but adoptively transferred T cells can persist long term, along with any unwanted effects. T cells targeting differentiation antigens can be expected to also recognize nonmalignant cells that express the same antigens, resulting in adverse events. For example, melanoma patients treated with T cells targeting melanocyte differentiation antigens, such as MART-1 and gp100, often develop vitiligo and uveitis. These on-target toxicities have been observed across all forms of therapeutic approaches, including tumor-infiltrating cells, in vitro-expanded T-cell clones and TCR-transgenic cells. In general, on-target autoimmunity is associated with tumor regression and is more prominent in treatment approaches that are more efficacious. On-target but off-tumour toxicities can be immediately life-threatening. For example, patients with colorectal cancer with lung and liver metastases may develop respiratory distress within 15 min of HER2-specific CAR T-cell infusion and may subsequently die from multiorgan failure 5 days later. As T-cell therapy becomes more effective, acute toxicities have also become more evident. Cytokine release syndrome, which is characterized by fevers, rigors, hypotension and hypoxia, has been observed in a number of CD19 CAR T-cell studies as a result of large-scale T-cell activation upon the recognition of CD19+ malignant cells.",

            "The human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus of the genus  and of the family Paramyxoviridae. Symptoms in adults typically resemble a sinus infection or the common cold, although the infection may be asymptomatic. In older adults (e.g., >60 years), RSV infection may progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Symptoms in children are often more severe, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia. It is estimated that in the United States, most children are infected with RSV by the age of three. The RSV virion consists of an internal nucleocapsid comprised of the viral RNA bound to nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), and large polymerase protein (L). The nucleocapsid is surrounded by matrix protein (M) and is encapsulated by a lipid bilayer into which the viral fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins as well as the small hydrophobic protein (SH) are incorporated. The viral genome also encodes two nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2), which inhibit type I interferon activity as well as the M-2 protein.",

With this technique, however, comes potential problems, including the possibility of insertional mutagenesis, which could lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inhibition of tumor suppressor genes."

            "For most known genetic diseases, correction of a point mutation in the target locus, rather than stochastic disruption of the gene, is needed to study or address the underlying cause of the disease. Current genome editing technologies utilizing the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) system introduce double-stranded DNA breaks at a target locus as the first step to gene correction. In response to double-stranded DNA breaks, cellular DNA repair processes mostly result in random insertions or deletions (indels) at the site of DNA cleavage through non-homologous end joining. Although most genetic diseases arise from point mutations, current approaches to point mutation correction are inefficient and typically induce an abundance of random insertions and deletions (indels) at the target locus resulting from the cellular response to dsDNA breaks. Therefore, there is a need for an improved form of genome editing that is more efficient and with far fewer undesired products such as stochastic insertions or deletions (indels) or translocations.",
            "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (A1AD) is a genetic disease in which pathogenic mutations in the SERPINA1 gene that encodes the alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) protein lead to diminished protein production in individuals having the disease. A1AT is a particularly good inhibitor of neutrophil elastase and protects tissues and organs such as the lung from elastin degradation. Consequently, elastin in the lungs of patients having A1AD is degraded more readily by neutrophil elastase, and over time, the loss in lung elasticity develops into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In healthy individuals, A1AT is produced by hepatocytes within the liver and is secreted into systemic circulation where the protein functions as a protease inhibitor.",
            "The most common pathogenic A1AT variant is a Guanine to Adenine (G\u2192A) mutation in the SERPINA1 gene, which results in a glutamate to lysine substitution at amino acid 342 of the A1AT protein. This substitution causes the protein to misfold and polymerize within hepatocytes, and ultimately, the toxic aggregates can lead to liver injury and cirrhosis. While the liver toxicity might potentially be addressed by a gene knockout (CRISPR/ZFN/TALEN) or gene knockdown (siRNA), neither of these approaches addresses the pulmonary pathology. Although pulmonary pathology may be addressed with protein replacement therapy, this therapy fails to address the liver toxicity. Gene therapy also would be inadequate to address the A1AT genetic defect. Because the livers of patients with A1AD are already under a severe disease burden caused by the endogenous A1AT aggregation, gene therapy that increases A1AT in the liver would be counterproductive. Therefore, there is a need for a method of treating patients with A1AD that addresses both the lung pathology and the liver toxicity which accompany the disease.",

            "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a genus of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae, in the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae. There are currently eight species in this genus, which have been identified and classified for different mammals, including humans, monkeys, and rodents. The most studied genus is human cytomegalovirus, also known as human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), which is widely distributed in the human population. Diseases associated with HHV-5 include mononucleosis and pneumonias. All herpesviruses share a characteristic ability to remain latent within the body over long periods of time. Although they may be found throughout the body, CMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands in humans and other mammals. Other CMV viruses are found in several mammal species, but species isolated from animals differ from HCMV in terms of genomic structure, and have not been reported to cause human disease.",
            "HCMV is endemic in most parts of the world. It is a ubiquitous large enveloped virus that infects 50 to 100% of the adult population worldwide. Although generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent hosts, HCMV infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised persons, such as infants following congenital or neonatal infections, transplant recipients, or AIDS patients.",
            "Primary infection normally results in subclinical disease after which the virus becomes latent, retaining the capacity to reactivate at a later time. The virus is transmitted through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk. In particular, individuals with undeveloped or compromised immunity are highly sensitive to infection by HCMV. It is estimated that at least 60% of the US population has been exposed to CMV, with a prevalence of more than 90% in high-risk groups (e.g., unborn babies whose mothers become infected with CMV during the pregnancy or people with HIV).",
            "In healthy individuals, HCMV typically causes an asymptomatic infection or produces mild, flulike symptoms. However, among two populations, HCMV is responsible for serious medical conditions. First, HCMV is a major cause of congenital defects in newborns infected in utero. Among congenitally infected newborns, 5-10% have major clinical symptoms at birth, such as microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, and hepatitis, as well as cytomegalic inclusion disease, which affects many tissues and organs including the central nervous system, liver, and retina and can lead to multi-organ failure and death. Other infants may be asymptomatic at birth, but later develop hearing loss or central nervous system abnormalities causing, in particular, poor intellectual performance and mental retardation. These pathologies are due in part to the ability of HCMV to enter and replicate in diverse cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, neurons, and monocytes/macrophages.",
            "The second population at risk are immunocompromised patients, such as those suffering from HIV infection and those undergoing transplantations. In this situation, the virus becomes an opportunistic pathogen and causes severe disease with high morbidity and mortality. The clinical disease causes a variety of symptoms including fever, pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, myelitis, colitis, uveitis, retinitis, and neuropathy. Rarer manifestations of HCMV infections in immunocompetent individuals include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, meningoencephalitis, pericarditis, myocarditis, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. Moreover, HCMV infection increases the risk of organ graft loss through transplant vascular sclerosis and restenosis, and may increase atherosclerosis in transplant patients as well as in the general population. It is estimated that HCMV infection causes clinical disease in 75% of patients in the first year after transplantation.",
            "There is currently no approved HCMV vaccine. Two candidate vaccines, Towne and gB/MF59, have completed phase II efficacy trials. The Towne vaccine appears protective against both infection and disease caused by challenge with pathogenic Toledo strain and also appears to be effective in preventing severe post-transplantation CMV disease. However, in a small phase II clinical trial, a low dose of Towne vaccine failed to show protection against infection of seronegative mothers who had children actively shedding CMV.",
            "The gB/MF59 vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine comprised of a transmembrane-deleted version of HCMV gB protein, which induces high levels of fibroblast entry neutralizing antibodies in humans and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in both adults and toddlers. A recent phase II double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the gB/MF59 vaccine revealed a 50% efficacy in inducing sterilizing immunity. As this vaccine induces potent antibody responses but very weak T-cell responses, the partial efficacy provided by the vaccine is thought to be primarily antibody-mediated. While this HCMV vaccine is the first to show any protective efficacy, its 50% protection falls short of the 80-90% desired for most vaccines.",
            "In addition, antibody therapy has been used to control HCMV infection in immunocompromised individuals and to reduce the pathological consequences of maternal-fetal transmission, although such therapy is usually not sufficient to eradicate the virus. HCMV immunoglobulins (Igs) have been administered to transplant patients in association with immunosuppressive treatments for prophylaxis of HCMV disease with mixed results. Antibody therapy has also been used to control congenital infection and prevent disease in newborns. However, these products are plasma derivatives with relatively low potency and have to be administered by intravenous infusion at very high doses in order to deliver sufficient amounts of neutralizing antibodies.",
            "HCMV is the leading viral cause of neurodevelopmental abnormality and other birth defects in children and the costs to society are substantial. Although antiviral therapy is available, the treatment with antiviral agents is imperfect and development of a CMV vaccine is the most promising strategy for preventing CMV infection. Given that the health and economic benefits of effective HCMV vaccines are significant, the US Institute of Medicine and US National Vaccine Program Office has categorized development of a CMV vaccine as a highest priority, but no candidate vaccine is under consideration for licensure."

        "abstract": "This invention provides for a novel means of incorporating non-native amino acids into preselected positions of a protein using a cell-free synthesis system. The methods involve the use of non-orthogonal, native isoaccepting sense tRNAs that are encoded by the genetic code. Such methods allow for numerous non-native amino acids to be incorporated through the use of sense codons without having to rely upon orthogonal tRNA-synthetase pairs.",
        "paragraph": [
            "Protein synthesis is a fundamental biological process that underlies the development of polypeptide therapeutics, vaccines, diagnostics, and industrial enzymes. With the advent of recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology, it has become possible to harness the catalytic machinery of the cell to produce a desired protein. This can be achieved within the cellular environment or in vitro using lysates derived from cells.",
            "Because only twenty amino acids are naturally incorporated into proteins, limitations to the production of a desired protein exist. For example, a peptide that is potentially useful as a therapeutic agent may be quickly degraded or otherwise inactivated upon administration to a patient as a result of proteases present within the patient. Likewise, infectious agents such as bacteria or viruses are more likely to develop resistance against peptides that contain only naturally occurring amino acids. This occurs because enzymes that are produced by the bacteria or virus that can inactivate a peptide drug are more likely to inactivate a peptide containing naturally occurring amino acids as opposed to a peptide containing non-native amino acids. Such limitations become even more apparent when compared with small organic molecule synthesis, in which any structural change can be made to influence functional properties of the compound. As a result, proteins containing non-native amino acids are becoming more auspicious for therapeutic uses. Furthermore, peptides containing non-native amino acids are extremely useful for non-therapeutic research purposes, such as uses relevant to the structural and functional probing of proteins, construction of peptide libraries for combinatorial chemistry, and proteomic studies.",
            "Although the twenty naturally occurring amino acids can be modified by post-translational modification, expanding the genetic code to include additional non-native amino acids with novel biological, chemical, or physical properties will increase the utility of the protein containing such novel non-native amino acids. Protein properties may include the size, acidity, nucleophilicity, hydrogen-bonding, or hydrophobicity of the protein.",
            "Different strategies have been utilized to synthesize peptides containing non-native amino acids. Synthetic peptide chemistry has been used routinely for this purpose. See, e.g., Eckert et al., Cell 99:103-15 (1999). However, routine solid-phase peptide synthesis is generally limited to small peptides with less than 100 residues. With the recent development of enzymatic ligation and native chemical ligation of peptide fragments, it is possible to make larger proteins. However, these methods are not easily scaled. See, e.g., Dawson and Kent, Annu Rev. Biochem. 69:923 (2000).",
            "In vivo translation using living cells is widely used for the efficient synthesis and post-translational modification of proteins from a genetically encoded natural or recombinant DNA sequence. However, folding may be inefficient if the protein is expressed in inclusion bodies. Most importantly, such methods are more difficult for the selective incorporation of multiple non-native amino acids, or to control the post-translational modification process.",
            "In vitro, or cell-free, protein synthesis offers several advantages over conventional in vivo protein expression methods. Cell-free systems can direct most, if not all, of the metabolic resources of the cell towards the exclusive production of one protein. Moreover, the lack of a cell wall and membrane components in vitro is advantageous since it allows for control of the synthesis environment. For example, tRNA levels can be changed to reflect the codon usage of genes being expressed. The redox potential, pH, or ionic strength can also be altered with greater flexibility than with in vivo protein synthesis because concerns of cell growth or viability do not exist. Furthermore, direct recovery of purified, properly folded protein products can be easily achieved.",
            "The productivity of cell-free systems has improved over 2-orders of magnitude in recent years, from about 5 \u03bcg/ml-hr to about 500 \u03bcg/ml-hr. Such improvements have made in vitro protein synthesis a practical technique for laboratory-scale research and provides a platform technology for high-throughput protein expression. It further indicates the feasibility for using cell-free technologies as an alternative means to in vivo large-scale, commercial production of protein pharmaceuticals.",
            "The incorporation of non-native amino acids into proteins remains a challenge with both in vivo and in vitro protein synthesis systems. A major hurdle in this field of endeavor is promoting recognition of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase with a non-native amino acid. An aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is an enzyme that catalyzes the bond of a specific amino acid to its cognate tRNA molecule. In most cases, each naturally occurring amino acid has one specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that will aminoacylate that amino acid to its proper tRNA molecule, which is known as tRNA charging. There exists relatively few aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases considering the fact that the degeneracy of the genetic code allows amino acids to be charged to more than one kind of isoaccepting sense tRNA molecule. Thus, the success of incorporating non-native amino acids into proteins depends on the recognition of the non-native amino acid by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which in general requires high selectively to insure the fidelity of protein translation. The fidelity of aminoacylation is maintained both at the level of substrate discrimination and proofreading of both non-cognate intermediates and protein products.",
            "One strategy has been to incorporate non-native amino acids into proteins using aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that cannot discriminate between non-native amino acids that are structurally similar to their natural counterparts due to lack of proofreading mechanisms. Because the proofreading activity of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase has been disabled, structural analogs of natural amino acids that have been misactivated may escape the editing functions of the synthetase, and be incorporated into the growing peptide chain as desired. See, e.g., Doring et al., Science 292:501 (2001).",
            "A major limitation of the abovementioned strategy is that all sites corresponding to a particular natural amino acid throughout the protein are replaced. The extent of incorporation of the natural and non-native amino acid may also vary because it is difficult to completely deplete the cognate natural amino acid inside the cell. Another limitation is that these strategies make it difficult to study the mutant protein in living cells because the multi-site incorporation of analogs often results in toxicity. Finally, this method is applicable in general only to close structural analogs of the common amino acids, again because substitutions must be tolerated at all sites in the genome.",
            "More recently, orthogonal tRNAs and corresponding orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that charge the orthogonal tRNA with the desired non-native amino acid has been used as a strategy to overcome previous limitations. An orthogonal tRNA is a tRNA that base pairs with a codon that is not normally associated with an amino acid such as a stop codon or 4 base pair codon, etc. Importantly, orthogonal components do not cross-react with any of the endogenous tRNAs, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, amino acids, or codons in the host organism.",
            "A commonly used orthogonal system for the incorporation of non-native amino acids is the amber suppressor orthogonal tRNA. Using this system, a suppressor tRNA is prepared that recognizes the stop codon UAG and is chemically aminoacylated with a non-native amino acid. Conventional site-directed mutagenesis is used to introduce the stop codon TAG at the site of interest in the protein gene. When the aminoacylated suppressor tRNA and the mutant gene are combined in an in vitro transcription/translation system, the non-native amino acid is incorporated in response to the UAG codon which gives a protein containing the non-native amino acid at the specified position. See, e.g., Sayers et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 16:791-802 (1988). Evidence has shown that the desired non-native amino acid is incorporated at the position specified by the UAG codon and that the non-native amino acid is not incorporated at any other site in the protein. See, e.g., Noren et al., Science 244:182-88 (1989); Ellman et al., Science 255: 197-200 (1992). For additional discussion of orthogonal translation systems that incorporate non-native amino acids, and methods for their production and use, see also Wang and Schultz, Chem.

Struct. 35:225-49 (2006); and Xie and Schultz, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 7:775-82 (2006).",
            "However, the incorporation of non-native amino acids using orthogonal components suffers from much lower yields because it relies on inherently inefficient suppressor tRNAs competing with termination factors. In addition, the use of orthogonal components for incorporation of non-native amino acids has been restricted to selective incorporation of only a single non-native amino acid per protein at only one of the three nonsense termination codons (the UAG amber stop codon) because of competition at amino acid sense codons from natural amino acids catalyzed by the tRNA charging and proofreading activities of the twenty different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and because attempts to use a second termination codon (UGA) often fails due to read-through by the ribosome. See, e.g., Cload et al., Chem. and Biol. 3:1033-38 (1996).",
            "While some attempts have been made to incorporate non-native amino acids into proteins using tRNAs that recognize sense codons, such attempts have been made using a pure reconstituted in vitro translation system. See Tan et al., Methods 36:279-90 (2005); Forster et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,977,150.

Conventional bacterial hosts for protein production have a reductive cytosol and thus are unable to form disulfide bonds in proteins expressed in the cytosol. As a result, currently many proteins cannot readily be expressed in bacterial cytosol and are instead expressed in eukaryotic or periplasmic expression systems. Although attempts to promote disulfide bond formation in bacterial cytosol have been made by introducing mutations into the bacterial host genome to disrupt reductive pathways, these efforts have yielded limited success. Thus, cytosolic production of disulfide-bonded proteins in bacteria remains a challenge."

Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion location of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disruption of normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unintended effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells. Common genome engineering strategies, such as ZFNs, TALENs, HEs, and MegaTALs, allow a specific area of the DNA to be modified, thereby increasing precision of the correction or insertion compared to earlier technologies.

For example, influenza infections are the seventh leading cause of death in the United States with 200, 000 hospitalizations and 40,000 deaths seen in the United States per year and cause about 3-5 million hospitalizations and about 300,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide per year. Millions of people receive flu vaccines to protect them from seasonal flu each year. Vaccination can also rapidly prevent the spread of an emerging influenze pandemic.",

The antigen or agent in the vaccine can stimulate the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a foreign invader, generate antibodies against it, destroy it and develop a memory of it. The vaccine-induced memory enables the immune system to act quickly to protect the body from any of these agents that it later encounters.",
            "Vaccine production used in the art e.g., antigen vaccine production, has several stages, including the generation of antigens, antigen purification and inactivation, and vaccine formulation. First, the antigen is generated through culturing viruses in cell lines, growing bacteria in bioreactors, or producing recombinant proteins derived from viruses and bacteria in cell cultures, yeast or bacteria. Recombinant proteins are then purified and the viruses and bacteria are inactivated before they are formulated with adjuvants in vaccines. It has been a challenge to drastically reduce the time and expense associated with current technologies in vaccine development.",
            "Another obstacle to the development of new vaccine is the constant evolution of most infectious agents, such as viruses and bacteria. Viruses often mutate their surface proteins to generate new antigens which can help them skipping the active immune system that has been immunized by vaccines containing the viruses. In contrast, bacteria acquire and mutate key proteins to evade host defense and effective antibiotic applications.",

Hemagglutinin (HA), the major envelop glycoprotein of influenza A and B viruses, or its homologue, hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) in influenza C virus, is the natural reservoir of the viruses. The rapid evolution of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the influenza virus results in the constant emergence of new strains, rendering the adaptive immune response of the host only partially protective to new infections. The biggest challenge for therapy and prophylaxis against influenza and other infections using traditional vaccines is the limitation of vaccines in breadth, providing protection only against closely related subtypes. In addition, today's length of the production process inhibits any fast reaction to develop and produce an adapted vaccine in a pandemic situation.",

            "Various approaches have been proposed to overcome allogeneic rejection of transplanted or engrafted cells including HLA-matching, blocking pathways that trigger T-cell activation with antibodies, use of a cocktail of immune suppressive drugs, and autologous cell therapy. Another strategy to dampen graft rejection involves minimization of allogenic differences between transplanted or engrafted cells and the recipient. The cell surface-expressed human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), molecules encoded by genes located in the human major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6, are the major mediators of immune rejection. Mismatch of a single HLA gene between the donor and subject can cause a robust immune response (Fleischhauer K. et al. \u201cBone marrow-allograft rejection by T lymphocytes recognizing a single amino acid difference in HLA-B44,\u201d N Engl J Med., 1990, 323:1818-1822). HLA genes are divided into MHC class I (MHC-I) and MHC class II (MHC-II). MHC-I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) are expressed in almost all tissue cell types, presenting \u201cnon-self\u201d antigen-processed peptides to CD8+ T cells, thereby promoting their activation to cytolytic CD8+T cells. Transplanted or engrafted cells expressing \u201cnon-self\u201d MHC-I molecules will cause a robust cellular immune response directed at these cells and ultimately resulting in their demise by activated cytolytic CD8+ T cells. MHC-I proteins are intimately associated with beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for forming functional MHC-I molecules on the cell surface.",
            "In contrast to the wide cellular expression of MHC-I genes, expression of MHC-II genes is restricted to antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. HLA antigen genes are the most polymorphic genes observed in the human genome (Rubinstein P., \u201cHLA matching for bone marrow transplantation\u2014how much is enough?\u201d N Engl J Med., 2001, 345:1842-1844). The generation of a \u201cuniversal donor\u201d cell that is compatible with any HLA genotype provides an alternative strategy that could resolve the immune rejection and associated economical costs of current methodologies for immune evasion.",
            "To generate such a line of universal donor cell(s), one previous approach has been to functionally disrupt the expression of MHC-I and MHC-II class genes. This could be achieved through genetic disruption, e.g., of both genetic alleles encoding the MHC-I light chain, B2M. The resulting B2M-null cell line and its derivatives would be expected to exhibit greatly reduced surface MHC-I and thus, reduced immunogenicity to allogeneic CD8+ T cells. The transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) targeting approach has been used to generate B2M-deficient hESC lines by deletion of a few nucleotides in exon 2 of the B2M gene (Lu, P. et al., \u201cGenerating hypoimmunogenic human embryonic stem cells by the disruption of beta 2-microglobulin,\u201d Stem Cell Rev. 2013, 9:806-813). Although the B2M-targeted hESC lines appeared to be surface HLA-I deficient, they were found to still contain mRNAs specific for B2M and MHC-I. The B2M and MHC-I mRNAs were expressed at levels equivalent to those of untargeted hESCs (both constitutive and IFN-g induced). Thus, concern exists that these TALEN B2M-targeted hESC lines might express residual cell surface MHC-I that would be sufficient to cause immune rejection, such as has been observed with B2M2/2 mouse cells that also express B2M mRNA (Gross, R. and Rappuoli, R. \u201cPertussis toxin promoter sequences involved in modulation,\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci, 1993, 90:3913-3917). Although the TALEN B2M targeted hESC lines were not examined for off-target cleavage events, the occurrence of nonspecific cleavage when using TALENs remains a significant issue that would impose a major safety concern on their clinical use (Grau, J. et al. \u201cTALENoffer: genome-wide TALEN off-target prediction,\u201d Bioinformatics, 2013, 29:2931-2932; Guilinger J. P. et al. \u201cBroad specificity profiling of TALENs results in engineered nucleases with improved DNA-cleavage specificity,\u201d Nat Methods 2014, 11:429-435). Further, another report generated IPS cells that escaped allogeneic recognition by knocking out a first B2M allele and knocking in a HLA-E gene at a second B2M allele, which resulted in surface expression of HLA-E dimers or trimers in the absence of surface expression of HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C (Gornalusse, G. G. et al., \u201cHLA-E-expressing pluripotent stem cells escape allogeneic responses and lysis by NK cells,\u201d Nature Biotechnology, 2017, 35, 765-773).",
            "A potential limitation of some of the above strategies are that MHC class I-negative cells are susceptible to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells as HLA molecules serve as major ligand inhibitors to natural killer (NK) cells. Host NK cells have been shown to eliminate transplanted or engrafted B2M\u2212/\u2212 donor cells, and a similar phenomenon occurs in vitro with MHC class-I-negative human leukemic lines (Bix, M. et al., \u201cRejection of class I MHC-deficient haemopoietic cells by irradiated MHC-matched mice,\u201d Nature, 1991, 349, 329-331; Zarcone, D. et al., \u201cHuman leukemia-derived cell lines and clones as models for mechanistic analysis of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity,\u201d Cancer Res. 1987, 47, 2674-2682). Thus, there exists a need to improve upon previous methods to generate universal donor cells that can evade the immune response as well as a need to generate cells that can survive post-engraftment. As described herein, cell survival post-engraftment may be mediated by a host of other pathways independent of allogeneic rejection e.g., hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress. Also as described herein, genetic introduction of survival factors (genes and/or proteins) may help cells to survive post-engraftment. As described herein, a universal donor cell line may combine properties that address both allogeneic rejection and survival post-engraftment."

During the initiation phase, the RNA polymerase binds to a specific promoter DNA sequence, opens the DNA duplex and feeds the template strand into the active site. T7 RNA polymerase, for example, forms a structure referred to as initiation complex, which includes a six-helix bundle sub-domain (the promoter binding domain) that interacts with the promoter to initiate DNA duplex melting. While bound to the promoter, the polymerase produces many short (truncated) transcripts from 2-12 nucleotides (nt) in length, a process often referred to as abortive synthesis/initiation. The truncated RNA transcripts cannot be converted to full-length transcripts by RNA polymerase and become by-products that accumulate during transcription. After the transition to the elongation phase and release of the promoter, the polymerase proceeds down the DNA template producing a full-length RNA transcript.",

Studies suggest that more than 70% of transcripts generated by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro may be run-on transcripts.

VZV only affects humans, and commonly causes chickenpox in children, teens and young adults and herpes zoster (shingles) in adults (rarely in children). The primary VZV infection, which results in chickenpox (varicella), may result in complications, including viral or secondary bacterial pneumonia. Even when the clinical symptoms of chickenpox have resolved, VZV remains dormant in the nervous system of the infected person (virus latency) in the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia. In about 10-20% of cases, VZV reactivates later in life, travelling from the sensory ganglia back to the skin where it produces a disease (rash) known as shingles or herpes zoster. VZV can also cause a number of neurologic conditions ranging from aseptic meningitis to encephalitis. Other serious complications of VZV infection include postherpetic neuralgia, Mollaret's meningitis, zoster multiplex, thrombocytopenia, myocarditis, arthritis, and inflammation of arteries in the brain leading to stroke, myelitis, herpes ophthalmicus, or zoster sine herpete.

As a result, two-dose vaccination is the adopted protocol; however, even with two doses of vaccine, there are reported incidences of breakthrough varicella. Furthermore, varicella vaccination has raised concerns that the immunity induced by the vaccine may not be lifelong, possibly leaving adults vulnerable to more severe disease as the immunity from their childhood immunization wanes.",
            "In 2005, the FDA approved the combined live attenuated combination measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine PROQUAD\u2122 (Merck) for use in persons 12 months to 12 years in age. While the attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine viruses in MMRV are identical and of equal titer to those in the MMR vaccine, the titer of Oka/Merck VZV is higher in MMRV vaccine than in single-antigen varicella vaccine.",
            "In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved ZOSTAVAX\u00ae (Merck) for the prevention of shingles (herpes zoster) in persons 60 years or older (currently 50-59 years of age is approved). ZOSTAVAX\u00ae contains the same Oka/Merck varicella zoster virus used in the varicella and MMRV vaccines, but at a much higher titer (>10-fold higher viral dose) than that present in both of these vaccines, as the concentrated formulation is designed to elicit an immune response in older adults whose immunity to VZV wanes with advancing age.",
            "Although the varicella vaccine has been shown to be safe in healthy individuals, there is evidence that immunity to VZV infection conferred by the vaccine wanes over time, rendering the vaccinated individuals susceptible to shingles, a more serious condition. In addition, there have been reports that individuals have developed chicken pox or shingles from the varicella vaccination. The vaccine may establish a latent infection in neural ganglia, which can then reactivate to cause herpes zoster.",
            "Moreover, live attenuated virus is not suitable for all subjects, including pregnant women and persons with moderate or severe acute illnesses. Also, varicella is not suitable or approved for immunocompromised patients, including persons with immunosuppression due to leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, immune deficiency disease or immunosuppressive therapy. Likewise, persons with moderate or severe cellular immunodeficiency resulting from infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) including those diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) should not receive the varicella vaccine. Thus, despite the high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with herpes zoster in immunocompromised individuals, this population is not eligible for vaccination with a live attenuated vaccine, such as ZOSTAVAX\u00ae.",

These disorders also include genetic defects, which result in the production of abnormal hemoglobins with an associated inability to maintain oxygen concentration. Many of these disorders are referred to as \u03b2-hemoglobinopathies because of their failure to produce normal \u03b2-globin protein in sufficient amounts or failure to produce normal \u03b2-globin protein entirely. For example, \u03b2-thalassemias result from a partial or complete defect in the expression of the \u03b2-globin gene, leading to deficient or absent adult hemogloblin (HbA). Sickle cell anemia results from a point mutation in the \u03b2-globin structural gene, leading to the production of an abnormal hemoglobin (HbS) (Atweh, Semin. Hematol. 38(4):367-73 (2001)). Hemoglobinopathies result in a reduction in the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, which can lead to symptoms such as weariness, dizziness, and shortness of breath, particularly when exercising.",

Genome engineering is a very active field of research because of the wide range of possible applications, particularly in the areas of human health; the correction of a gene carrying a harmful mutation, for example, or to explore the function of a gene. Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disrupting normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unwanted effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells. Recent genome engineering strategies, such as ZFNs, TALENs, HEs and MegaTALs, enable a specific area of the DNA to be modified, thereby increasing the precision of the correction or insertion compared to early technologies. These newer platforms offer a much larger degree of reproducibility, but still have their limitations.",

The universal donor cells comprise at least one genetic modification within or near at least one gene that encodes one or more MHC-I or MHC-II human leukocyte antigens or component or transcriptional regulator of the MHC-I or MHC-II complex, at least one genetic modification that increases the expression of at least one polynucleotide that encodes a tolerogenic factor, and optionally at least one genetic modification that increases or decreases the expression of at least one gene that encodes a survival factor.",

            "Various approaches have been proposed to overcome allogeneic rejection of transplanted or engrafted cells including HLA-matching, blocking pathways that trigger T-cell activation with antibodies, use of a cocktail of immune suppressive drugs, and autologous cell therapy. Another strategy to dampen graft rejection involves minimization of allogenic differences between transplanted or engrafted cells and the recipient. The cell surface-expressed human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), molecules encoded by genes located in the human major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6, are the major mediators of immune rejection. Mismatch of a single HLA gene between the donor and subject can cause a robust immune response (Fleischhauer K. et al. \u201cBone marrow-allograft rejection by T lymphocytes recognizing a single amino acid difference in HLA-B44,\u201d N Engl J Med., 1990, 323:1818-1822). HLA genes are divided into MHC class I (MHC-I) and MHC class II (MHC-II). MHC-I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) are expressed in almost all tissue cell types, presenting \u201cnon-self\u201d antigen-processed peptides to CD8+ T cells, thereby promoting their activation to cytolytic CD8+ T cells. Transplanted or engrafted cells expressing \u201cnon-self\u201d MHC-I molecules will cause a robust cellular immune response directed at these cells and ultimately resulting in their demise by activated cytolytic CD8+ T cells. MHC-I proteins are intimately associated with beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for forming functional MHC-I molecules on the cell surface.",
            "In contrast to the wide cellular expression of MHC-I genes, expression of MHC-II genes is restricted to antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. HLA antigen genes are the most polymorphic genes observed in the human genome (Rubinstein P., \u201cHLA matching for bone marrow transplantation\u2014how much is enough?\u201d N Engl J Med., 2001, 345:1842-1844). The generation of a \u201cuniversal donor\u201d cell that is compatible with any HLA genotype provides an alternative strategy that could resolve the immune rejection and associated economical costs of current methodologies for immune evasion.",
            "To generate such a line of universal donor cell(s), one previous approach has been to functionally disrupt the expression of MHC-I and MHC-II class genes. This could be achieved through genetic disruption, e.g., of both genetic alleles encoding the MHC-I light chain, B2M. The resulting B2M KO cell line and its derivatives would be expected to exhibit greatly reduced surface MHC-I and thus, reduced immunogenicity to allogeneic CD8+ T cells. The transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) targeting approach has been used to generate B2M-deficient hESC lines by deletion of a few nucleotides in exon 2 of the B2M gene (Lu, P. et al., \u201cGenerating hypoimmunogenic human embryonic stem cells by the disruption of beta 2-microglobulin,\u201d Stem Cell Rev. 2013, 9:806-813). Although the B2M-targeted hESC lines appeared to be surface HLA-I deficient, they were found to still contain mRNAs specific for B2M and MHC-I. The B2M and MHC-I mRNAs were expressed at levels equivalent to those of untargeted hESCs (both constitutive and IFN-g induced). Thus, concern exists that these TALEN B2M-targeted hESC lines might express residual cell surface MHC-I that would be sufficient to cause immune rejection, such as has been observed with B2M2/2 mouse cells that also express B2M mRNA (Gross, R. and Rappuoli, R. \u201cPertussis toxin promoter sequences involved in modulation,\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci, 1993, 90:3913-3917). Although the TALEN B2M targeted hESC lines were not examined for off-target cleavage events, the occurrence of nonspecific cleavage when using TALENs remains a significant issue that would impose a major safety concern on their clinical use (Grau, J. et al. \u201cTALENoffer: genome-wide TALEN off-target prediction,\u201d Bioinformatics, 2013, 29:2931-2932; Guilinger J. P. et al. \u201cBroad specificity profiling of TALENs results in engineered nucleases with improved DNA-cleavage specificity,\u201d Nat Methods 2014, 11:429-435). Further, another report generated IPS cells that escaped allogeneic recognition by knocking out a first B2M allele and knocking in a HLA-E gene at a second B2M allele, which resulted in surface expression of HLA-E dimers or trimers in the absence of surface expression of HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C (Gornalusse, G. G. et al., \u201cHLA-E-expressing pluripotent stem cells escape allogeneic responses and lysis by NK cells,\u201d Nature Biotechnology, 2017, 35, 765-773).",
            "A potential limitation of some of the above strategies are that MHC class I-negative cells are susceptible to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells as HLA molecules serve as major ligand inhibitors to natural killer (NK) cells. Host NK cells have been shown to eliminate transplanted or engrafted B2M\u2212/\u2212 donor cells, and a similar phenomenon occurs in vitro with MHC class-I-negative human leukemic lines (Bix, M. et al., \u201cRejection of class I MHC-deficient haemopoietic cells by irradiated MHC-matched mice,\u201d Nature, 1991, 349, 329-331; Zarcone, D. et al., \u201cHuman leukemia-derived cell lines and clones as models for mechanistic analysis of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity,\u201d Cancer Res. 1987, 47, 2674-2682). Thus, there exists a need to improve upon previous methods to generate universal donor cells that can evade the immune response as well as a need to generate cells that can survive post-engraftment. As described herein, cell survival post-engraftment may be mediated by a host of other pathways independent of allogeneic rejection e.g., hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress. Also as described herein, genetic introduction of survival factors (genes and/or proteins) may help cells to survive post-engraftment. As described herein, a universal donor cell line may combine properties that address both allogeneic rejection and survival post-engraftment."

            "Hemophilia A (HemA) is caused by a genetic defect in the FVIII gene (F8) that results in low or undetectable levels of FVIII protein in the blood. This results in ineffective clot formation at sites of tissue injury leading to uncontrolled bleeding that can be fatal if not treated. Replacement of the missing or nonfunctional FVIII protein is an effective treatment for HemA subjects and is the current standard of care. However, protein replacement therapy requires frequent intravenous administration of FVIII protein which is inconvenient in adults, problematic in children, cost prohibitive (>S200,000/year), and can result in break through bleeding events if the treatment regimen is not closely followed.",
            "A permanent cure for hemophilia A is highly desirable. While virus-based gene therapy using Adeno Associated Virus (AAV) has shown some promise in preclinical animal models and in human subjects, it has a number of disadvantages. For example, reported AAV based gene therapy uses a FVIII coding sequence driven by a liver-specific promoter that is encapsulated inside an AAV virus capsid (generally using the serotypes AAV5, AAV8 or AAV9 or AAVrh10, among others). In general, AAV viruses used for gene therapy deliver the packaged coding sequence cassette into the nucleus of the transduced cells, where the cassette remains almost exclusively episomal, and it is the episomal copies of the therapeutic coding sequence that give rise to the therapeutic protein. AAV does not have a mechanism to integrate the encapsulated DNA into the genome of the host cells. Because the therapeutic coding sequence is maintained as an episome, it is not coordinately replicated when the host cell divides so can be lost from daughter cells. It has been demonstrated that when liver cells containing AAV episomes are induced to divide, the AAV genome is not replicated but is instead diluted. Accordingly, AAV based gene therapy is not expected to be effective in children whose livers have not yet achieved adult size. Because current therapies are inadequate, there is a critical need for new effective and permanent or long-lasting treatments for HemA for adults and children.",
            "FVIII is initially expressed as a protein having the domain structure A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. The protein is activated by proteolytic cleavage of the bulky, heavily glycosylated B domain, leaving a heavy chain (A1-A2) and light chain (A3-C1-C2) heterodimer. The B domain of the FVIII protein is not required for biological activity. Removal of the large B domain from the FVIII coding sequence is essential to enable reliable packaging into AAV vectors used for in vivo delivery. However, removal of the B domain, which contains up to 18 N-linked glycosylation sites, results in impaired secretion of FVIII protein. Thus, there is a critical need for improved forms of FVIII which can be efficiently and effectively expressed."

Introduced DNA can integrate into host cell genomic DNA at some frequency, resulting in alterations and/or damage to the host cell genomic DNA. In addition, multiple steps must occur before a protein is made. Once inside the cell, DNA must be transported into the nucleus where it is transcribed into RNA. The RNA transcribed from DNA must then enter the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. This need for multiple processing steps creates lag times before the generation of a protein of interest.

Other aliases for Gal-1 are: galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase deficiency, GALT deficiency, and classic galactosemia. Gal-1 usually presents in neonates after lactose ingestion and causes feeding difficulties, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, hepatocellular insufficiency, hypoglycemia, renal tubular dysfunction, muscle hypotonia, sepsis, cataracts, and possibly death in the short-term. Long-term symptoms include mental retardation, verbal dyspraxia, motor abnormalities, and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Bosch A M. J Inherit Metab Dis. 29: 516-525 (2006). It has an estimated incidence of 1 in 60,000 with a higher incidence in Europe and the United States. Current treatment for Gal-1 is primarily via dietary control to limit consumption of galactose and lactose, which is metabolized to galactose and glucose, to prevent accumulation of galactose. Karadag N. et al.,  59:1139-1146 (2013).",
            "The principal gene associated with Gal-1 is Galactose-1-Phosphate Uridylyltransferase (\u201cGALT\u201d), which has two variants (NM_000155; NM_001258332; NP_000146; NP_001245261 also referred to as UDP-Glucose-Hexose-1-Phosphate Uridylyltransferase and Gal-1-P Uridylyltransferase). GALT is a metabolic enzyme (E.C. 2.7.7.12) that plays a critical role in the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism. Specifically, GALT's biological function is to convert UDP-glucose and galactose-1-phosphate to glucose-1-phosphate and UDP-galactose. Timson D J,  (2015) doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2015.06.077. GALT is expressed in a variety of tissues, primarily the liver, localizes to the Golgi apparatus and cytoplasm of cells, and exists as a homodimer in its native form. The first isoform of human GALT is 379 amino acids, while its second isoform is 270 amino acids. Both isoforms have four iron binding sites and at least one zinc binding site.",
            "A complete or partial loss of GALT function leads to abnormal buildup of galactose. For example, loss of GALT has been reported to lead to galactose levels greater than 100 mg/dL in an individual as compared to less than 10 mg/dL in normal individuals. Treatment for Gal-1 generally focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications, e.g., through diet restrictions. There are no commercial therapeutics to treat Gal-1, thus, there is a need for improved therapy to treat Gal-1."

            "Genome engineering refers to the strategies and techniques for the targeted, specific modification of the genetic information (genome) of living organisms. Genome engineering is a very active field of research because of the wide range of possible applications, particularly in the areas of human health. For example, genome engineering can be used to alter (e.g., correct or knock-out) a gene carrying a harmful mutation or to explore the function of a gene. Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disrupting normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unwanted effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells. Recent genome engineering strategies, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), homing endonucleases (HEs) and MegaTALs, enable a specific area of the DNA to be modified, thereby increasing the precision of the alteration compared to early technologies. These newer platforms offer a much larger degree of reproducibility, but still have their limitations.",

With the host of undesired consequences brought about by standard treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy used today, genetic therapy for the manipulation of disease-related peptides and their functions provides a more targeted approach to disease diagnosis, treatment and management.

One approach to achieve these goals is to use tumor-directed immunotherapy, i.e., to focus the immune activation to the most relevant part of the immune system. This may improve anti-tumor efficacy as well as reduce immune-related adverse events. Tumor-directed immune activation can be achieved by local injections of immune modulators directly into the tumor or into the tumor area. Therapies focused on targeting checkpoint inhibitors and co-stimulatory receptors can generate tumor-specific T cell responses through localized immune activation.",

Activation of this immune checkpoints results in T cell deactivation and commandeering these pathways by tumor cells contributes to their successful immune escape.",

Data available from these trials indicate substantial activity accompanied by a favorable safety and toxicity profile in these patient populations.",
            "For example, checkpoint inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of melanoma. In particular, phase III clinical trials have revealed that therapies such as ipilimumab and pembrolizumab, which target the CTLA-4 and PD-1 immune checkpoints, respectively, have raised the three-year survival of patients with melanoma to \u02dc70%, and overall survival (>5 years) to \u02dc30%.",
            "Likewise, checkpoint inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of head and neck cancer. In preclinical studies, it had been shown that that 45-80% of HNSCC tumors express programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) (Zandberg et al. (2014) Oral Oncol. 50:627-632). Currently there are dozens of clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy or in combination regimens in HNSCC. For example, clinical trials with PD 1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 inhibitors are being tested in HNSCC. Data that the PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab might be effective in metastatic/recurrent (R/M) HNSCC patients were generated in the phase 1b Keynote-012 phase I/II trial (Cheng. ASCO 2015, oral presentation). More recently the data of the randomized CheckMate-141 phase III clinical trial were presented (Gillison. AACR 2016, oral presentation).

            "Various approaches have been proposed to overcome allogeneic rejection of transplanted or engrafted cells including HLA-matching, blocking pathways that trigger T-cell activation with antibodies, use of a cocktail of immune suppressive drugs, and autologous cell therapy. Another strategy to dampen graft rejection involves minimization of allogenic differences between transplanted or engrafted cells and the recipient. The cell surface-expressed human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), molecules encoded by genes located in the human major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6, are the major mediators of immune rejection. Mismatch of a single HLA gene between the donor and subject can cause a robust immune response (Fleischhauer K. et al. \u201cBone marrow-allograft rejection by T lymphocytes recognizing a single amino acid difference in HLA-B44,\u201d N Engl J Med., 1990, 323:1818-1822). HLA genes are divided into MHC class I (MHC-I) and MHC class II (MHC-II). MHC-I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) are expressed in almost all tissue cell types, presenting \u201cnon-self\u201d antigen-processed peptides to CD8+ T cells, thereby promoting their activation to cytolytic CD8+ T cells. Transplanted or engrafted cells expressing \u201cnon-self\u201d MHC-I molecules will cause a robust cellular immune response directed at these cells and ultimately resulting in their demise by activated cytolytic CD8+ T cells. MHC-I proteins are intimately associated with beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for forming functional MHC-I molecules on the cell surface.",
            "In contrast to the wide cellular expression of MHC-I genes, expression of MHC-II genes is restricted to antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. HLA antigen genes are the most polymorphic genes observed in the human genome (Rubinstein P., \u201cHLA matching for bone marrow transplantation\u2014how much is enough?\u201d N Engl J Med., 2001, 345:1842-1844). The generation of a \u201cuniversal donor\u201d cell that is compatible with any HLA genotype provides an alternative strategy that could resolve the immune rejection and associated economical costs of current methodologies for immune evasion.",
            "To generate such a line of universal donor cell(s), one previous approach has been to functionally disrupt the expression of MHC-I and MHC-II class genes. This could be achieved through genetic disruption, e.g., of both genetic alleles encoding the MHC-I light chain, B2M. The resulting B2M KO cell line and its derivatives would be expected to exhibit greatly reduced surface MHC-I and thus, reduced immunogenicity to allogeneic CD8+ T cells. The transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) targeting approach has been used to generate B2M-deficient hESC lines by deletion of a few nucleotides in exon 2 of the B2M gene (Lu, P. et al., \u201cGenerating hypoimmunogenic human embryonic stem cells by the disruption of beta 2-microglobulin,\u201d Stem Cell Rev. 2013, 9:806-813). Although the B2M-targeted hESC lines appeared to be surface HLA-I deficient, they were found to still contain mRNAs specific for B2M and MHC-I. The B2M and MHC-I mRNAs were expressed at levels equivalent to those of untargeted hESCs (both constitutive and IFN-g induced). Thus, concern exists that these TALEN B2M-targeted hESC lines might express residual cell surface MHC-I that would be sufficient to cause immune rejection, such as has been observed with B2M2/2 mouse cells that also express B2M mRNA (Gross, R. and Rappuoli, R. \u201cPertussis toxin promoter sequences involved in modulation,\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci, 1993, 90:3913-3917). Although the TALEN B2M targeted hESC lines were not examined for off-target cleavage events, the occurrence of nonspecific cleavage when using TALENs remains a significant issue that would impose a major safety concern on their clinical use (Grau, J. et al. \u201cTALENoffer: genome-wide TALEN off-target prediction,\u201d Bioinformatics, 2013, 29:2931-2932; Guilinger J. P. et al. \u201cBroad specificity profiling of TALENs results in engineered nucleases with improved DNA-cleavage specificity,\u201d Nat Methods 2014, 11:429-435). Further, another report generated IPS cells that escaped allogeneic recognition by knocking out a first B2M allele and knocking in a HLA-E gene at a second B2M allele, which resulted in surface expression of HLA-E dimers or trimers in the absence of surface expression of HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C (Gornalusse, G. G. et al., \u201cHLA-E-expressing pluripotent stem cells escape allogeneic responses and lysis by NK cells,\u201d Nature Biotechnology, 2017, 35, 765-773).",
            "A potential limitation of some of the above strategies are that MHC class I-negative cells are susceptible to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells as HLA molecules serve as major ligand inhibitors to natural killer (NK) cells. Host NK cells have been shown to eliminate transplanted or engrafted B2M\u2212/\u2212 donor cells, and a similar phenomenon occurs in vitro with MHC class-I-negative human leukemic lines (Bix, M. et al., \u201cRejection of class I MHC-deficient haemopoietic cells by irradiated MHC-matched mice,\u201d Nature, 1991, 349, 329-331; Zarcone, D. et al., \u201cHuman leukemia-derived cell lines and clones as models for mechanistic analysis of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity,\u201d Cancer Res. 1987, 47, 2674-2682). Thus, there exists a need to improve upon previous methods to generate universal donor cells that can evade the immune response as well as a need to generate cells that can survive post-engraftment. As described herein, cell survival post-engraftment may be mediated by a host of other pathways independent of allogeneic rejection e.g., hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress. Also as described herein, genetic introduction of survival factors (genes and/or proteins) may help cells to survive post-engraftment. As described herein, a universal donor cell line may combine properties that address both allogeneic rejection and survival post-engraftment."

            "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a genus of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae, in the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae. There are currently eight species in this genus, which have been identified and classified for different mammals, including humans, monkeys, and rodents. The most studied genus is human cytomegalovirus, also known as human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), which is widely distributed in the human population. Diseases associated with HHV-5 include mononucleosis and pneumonias. All herpesviruses share a characteristic ability to remain latent within the body over long periods of time. Although they may be found throughout the body, CMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands in humans and other mammals. Other CMV viruses are found in several mammal species, but species isolated from animals differ from HCMV in terms of genomic structure, and have not been reported to cause human disease.",
            "HCMV is endemic in most parts of the world. It is a ubiquitous large enveloped virus that infects 50 to 100% of the adult population worldwide. Although generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent hosts, HCMV infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised persons, such as infants following congenital or neonatal infections, transplant recipients, or AIDS patients.",
            "Primary infection normally results in subclinical disease after which the virus becomes latent, retaining the capacity to reactivate at a later time. The virus is transmitted through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk. In particular, individuals with undeveloped or compromised immunity are highly sensitive to infection by HCMV. It is estimated that at least 60% of the US population has been exposed to CMV, with a prevalence of more than 90% in high-risk groups (e.g., unborn babies whose mothers become infected with CMV during the pregnancy or people with HIV).",
            "In healthy individuals, HCMV typically causes an asymptomatic infection or produces mild, flulike symptoms. However, among two populations, HCMV is responsible for serious medical conditions. First, HCMV is a major cause of congenital defects in newborns infected in utero. Among congenitally infected newborns, 5-10% have major clinical symptoms at birth, such as microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, and hepatitis, as well as cytomegalic inclusion disease, which affects many tissues and organs including the central nervous system, liver, and retina and can lead to multi-organ failure and death. Other infants may be asymptomatic at birth, but later develop hearing loss or central nervous system abnormalities causing, in particular, poor intellectual performance and mental retardation. These pathologies are due in part to the ability of HCMV to enter and replicate in diverse cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, neurons, and monocytes/macrophages.",
            "The second population at risk are immunocompromised patients, such as those suffering from HIV infection and those undergoing transplantations. In this situation, the virus becomes an opportunistic pathogen and causes severe disease with high morbidity and mortality. The clinical disease causes a variety of symptoms including fever, pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, myelitis, colitis, uveitis, retinitis, and neuropathy. Rarer manifestations of HCMV infections in immunocompetent individuals include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, meningoencephalitis, pericarditis, myocarditis, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. Moreover, HCMV infection increases the risk of organ graft loss through transplant vascular sclerosis and restenosis, and may increase atherosclerosis in transplant patients as well as in the general population. It is estimated that HCMV infection causes clinical disease in 75% of patients in the first year after transplantation.",
            "There is currently no approved HCMV vaccine. Two candidate vaccines, Towne and gB/MF59, have completed phase II efficacy trials. The Towne vaccine appears protective against both infection and disease caused by challenge with pathogenic Toledo strain and also appears to be effective in preventing severe post-transplantation CMV disease. However, in a small phase II clinical trial, a low dose of Towne vaccine failed to show protection against infection of seronegative mothers who had children actively shedding CMV.",
            "The gB/MF59 vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine comprised of a transmembrane-deleted version of HCMV gB protein, which induces high levels of fibroblast entry neutralizing antibodies in humans and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in both adults and toddlers. A recent phase II double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the gB/MF59 vaccine revealed a 50% efficacy in inducing sterilizing immunity. As this vaccine induces potent antibody responses but very weak T-cell responses, the partial efficacy provided by the vaccine is thought to be primarily antibody-mediated. While this HCMV vaccine is the first to show any protective efficacy, its 50% protection falls short of the 80-90% desired for most vaccines.",
            "In addition, antibody therapy has been used to control HCMV infection in immunocompromised individuals and to reduce the pathological consequences of maternal-fetal transmission, although such therapy is usually not sufficient to eradicate the virus. HCMV immunoglobulins (Igs) have been administered to transplant patients in association with immunosuppressive treatments for prophylaxis of HCMV disease with mixed results. Antibody therapy has also been used to control brief infection and prevent disease in newborns. However, these products are plasma derivatives with relatively low potency and have to be administered by intravenous infusion at very high doses in order to deliver sufficient amounts of neutralizing antibodies.",
            "HCMV is the leading viral cause of neurodevelopmental abnormality and other birth defects in children and the costs to society are substantial. Although antiviral therapy is available, the treatment with antiviral agents is imperfect and development of a CMV vaccine is the most promising strategy for preventing CMV infection. Given that the health and economic benefits of effective HCMV vaccines are significant, the US Institute of Medicine and US National Vaccine Program Office has categorized development of a CMV vaccine as a highest priority, but no candidate vaccine is under consideration for licensure."

Blood is a fluid comprising, e.g., plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets that is circulated by the heart through the vertebrate vascular system. The circulatory system becomes a reservoir for many toxins and pathogenic molecules upon their introduction to or production by the body. The circulatory system also serves as a reservoir for cellular secretions or detritus from within the body. The perpetual or aberrant circulation and proliferation of such molecules and entities can drive disease and/or exacerbate existing conditions.",

The short half-life often necessitates repeated injections and hospitalizations. It is thought that the short half-life may be due to both renal clearance, e.g., of proteins smaller than 60 kDa, and non-renal clearance, e.g., via liver excretion or immune-mediated removal. The activity of therapies is also often limited by an immune reaction elicited against them (see, e.g., Wang et al., Leukemia 2003, 17:1583). Several approaches are practiced in the art.",
            "One approach includes the use of \u201cerythrocyte ghosts\u201d that are derived from a hemolyzed red blood cell. To prepare erythrocyte ghosts, red blood cells undergo hypotonic lysis. The red blood cells are exposed to low ionic strength buffer causing them to burst. The resulting lysed cell membranes are isolated by centrifugation. The pellet of lysed red blood cell membranes is resuspended and incubated in the presence of the therapeutic agent, for example, such as an antibiotic or chemotherapeutic agent in a low ionic strength buffer. The therapeutic agent distributes within the cells. Erythrocyte ghosts and derivatives used to encapsulate payloads, such as therapeutic agents, can shield those payloads from the immune system, but the erythrocyte ghosts themselves are subject to rapid clearance by the reticulo-endothelial system (see, e.g., Loegering et al. 1987 Infect Immun 55(9):2074). Erythrocyte ghosts also elicit an immune response in mammalian subjects. These vesicles are typically constituted of both lipids and proteins, including potentially high amounts of phosphatidylserine, which is normally found on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This leads to potential immunological reactions in the recipient mammalian subjects. The undesirable effects seriously limit the potential for therapeutic applications of technologies based on erythrocyte ghosts.",
            "Another approach for drug encapsulation includes the use of exosomes. \u201cExosomes\u201d include cell-derived vesicles that are present in many and perhaps all biological fluids, including blood, urine, and cultured medium of cell cultures. The reported diameter of exosomes is between 30 and 100 nm, which is larger than low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but smaller than, for example, red blood cells. Exosomes are either released from the cell when multivesicular bodies fuse with the plasma membrane or they are released directly from the plasma membrane. Exosome delivery methods require a better understanding of their biology, as well as the development of production, characterization, targeting and cargo-loading nanotechnologies. Attempts have been made to manufacture exosomes using human embryonic stem cell derived mesenchymal stem cells (hESC-MSCs). However, as hESC-MSCs are not infinitely expansible, large scale production of exosomes would require replenishment of hESC-MSC through derivation from hESCs and incur recurring costs for testing and validation of each new batch (Chen et al. 2011 Journal of Translational Medicine 9:47). Clinical translation is also hindered by the lack of suitable and scalable nanotechnologies for the purification and loading of exosomes (Lakhal and Wood 2011 BioEssays 33(10):737). Current ultracentrifugation protocols are commercially unreproducible, as they produce a heterogeneous mix of exosomes, other cellular vesicles and macromolecular complexes. Therefore, purification methods based on the use of specific, desired markers, such as the expression of a targeting moiety on the surface of the exosome, are required. In addition, siRNA loading into exosomes is relatively inefficient and cost-ineffective, highlighting the need for the development of transfection reagents tailored for nanoparticle applications. Further, exosomes are rapidly cleared from circulation and substantially accumulate in the liver within 24 hours of administration (Ohno et al., 2013 Mol Therapy 21(1):185), limiting their application for long-term drug delivery to the circulatory of a subject.",
            "Polyethylene glycol-coated liposomes are presently used as carriers for in vivo drug delivery. A \u201cliposome\u201d includes an artificially-prepared spherical vesicle composed of a lamellar phase lipid bilayer. The liposome can be used as a vehicle for administration of nutrients and pharmaceutical agents. Liposomes can be prepared by disrupting biological membranes, e.g., by sonication. Liposomes are often composed of phosphatidylcholine-enriched phospholipids and may also contain mixed lipid chains with surfactant properties such as egg phosphatidylethanolamine. A liposome design may employ surface ligands for attaching to a target, e.g., unhealthy tissue. Types of liposomes include the multilamellar vesicle (MLV), the small unilamellar liposome vesicle (SUV), the large unilamellar vesicle (LUV), and the cochleate vesicle. Liposomes as carriers of anthracycline antibiotics have been a subject of a great number of studies. As a result, liposome formulations of daunorubicin (DaunoXome\u2122) and doxorubicin (Doxil\u2122) are now commercially available. The pharmacokinetics of the liposomal forms of anthracycline antibiotics differ from that of their free forms in higher peak concentrations and longer circulations times of the drugs. The kinetics of DaunoXome and Doxil clearance from plasma is close to mono-exponential. The half-life of DaumoXome in patient plasma is on the order of a few hours. In Doxil, polyethylene glycol-coated liposomes are used. The immune system poorly recognizes such liposomes; therefore the plasma half-life of Doxil is in the order of tens of hours.",
            "Red blood cells have been considered for use, e.g., to degrade toxic metabolites or inactivate xenobiotics, as drug delivery systems, as carriers of antigens for vaccination, and in other biomedical applications (Magnani Ed. 2003, Erythrocyte Engineering for Drug Delivery and Targeting). Many of these applications require procedures for the transient opening of pores across the red cell membrane. Drugs have commonly been loaded into freshly isolated red blood cells, without culturing, using disruptive methods based on hypotonic shock. Hypotonic dialysis can induce a high degree of hemolysis, irreversible modifications in the morphology of the cells and phosphotidyl serine exposure, which has been recognized as an important parameter associated with premature red blood cells removal and induction of transfusion-related pathologies (Favretto 2013 J Contr Rel).",
            "Many drugs, particularly protein therapeutics, stimulate immunogenic responses that include B cell antibody production, T cell activation, and macrophage phagocytosis. The causes of immunogenicity can be extrinsic or intrinsic to the protein. Extrinsic factors are drug formulation, aggregate formation, degradation products, contaminants and dosing. The administration mode, as well as the drug regimen, also strongly influences how immunogenicity is assessed. That is, immunogenicity will have different effects for drugs that are given in acute indications compared to drugs to treat chronic diseases. In the latter case, patients are exposed to the drug over a longer period of time and as such can mount a complete response. Pegylation is a technology designed to prolong the half-life, as well as minimize immunogenic responses. In contrast to assumptions that polyethylene glycol (PEG) is non-immunogenic and non-antigenic, certain animal studies show that uricase, ovalbumin and some other PEGylated agents can elicit antibody formation against PEG (anti-PEG). In humans, anti-PEG may limit therapeutic efficacy and/or reduce tolerance of PEG-asparaginase (PEG-ASNase) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and of pegloticase in patients with chronic gout, but did not impair hyposensitization of allergic patients with mPEG-modified ragweed extract or honeybee venom or the response to PEG-IFN in patients with hepatitis C. Anti-PEG antibodies can be found in 22-25% of healthy blood donors. Two decades earlier, the occurrence was 0.2%. This increase may be due to an improvement of the limit of detection of antibodies and to greater exposure to PEG and PEG-containing compounds in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and processed food products. These results raise concerns regarding the efficacy of PEG-conjugated drugs for a subset of patients (Garay, Expert Opin Drug Deliv, 2012 9(11):1319).",
            "Attempts in the art to create passive half-life improvement methods focus on increasing the apparent hydrodynamic radius of a drug. The kidney's glomerular filtration apparatus is the primary site in the body where blood components are filtered, see for reference e.g., Osicka et al. Clin Sci 1997 93:65 and Myers et al. Kidney Int 1982 21:633. The main determinant of filtration is the hydrodynamic radius of the molecule in the blood; smaller molecules (<80 kDa) are filtered out of the blood to a higher extent than larger molecules. Researchers have used this generalized rule to modify drugs to exhibit a larger hydrodynamic radius and thus longer half-life, mainly via chemical conjugation to large molecular weight water-soluble polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). Numerous PEGylated protein and small molecule therapeutics are currently offered in the clinic (Pasut and Veronese, 2009 Adv Drug Deliv Rev 61(13):1177; Fishburn, 2008 J Pharm Sci 97(10):4167). Though effective in many cases in increasing circulation half-life, especially as the hydrodynamic radius of the graft or fusion increases (Gao, Liu, et al., 2009 PNAS 106(36):15231), these methods offer challenges in manufacturing and maintenance of biological effector function. Heterogeneities in conjugation reactions can cause complex product mixtures with varying biological activities, due mostly to the utilization of site-unspecific chemistries. Extensive biochemical characterization often follows precise purification methods to retain a homogenous therapeutic product (Huang, Gough, et al, 2009 Anal Chem 81(2):567; Bailon, Palleroni, et al., 2001 Bioconj Chem 12(2):195; Dhalluin, Ross, et al., 2005 Bioconj Chem 16(3):504). Furthermore, attachment of large moieties, such as branched PEGs, to reactive zones of proteins can lead to decreased receptor affinity (Fishburn, 2008 J Pharm Sci 97(10):4167).",
            "Albumin may be used to bind a therapeutic protein for increased circulation of the drug (Dennis et al, 2002 J Bil Chem 277(38):35035; Walker, Dunlevy, et al., 2010 Prot Engr Des Sel 23(4):271) to increase the apparent size of the therapeutic by engineering it to bind another protein in the blood. In this manner, the drug attains its large molecular size only after administration into the blood stream. The addition of affinity-matured serum albumin-binding peptides to antibody fragments increased their circulation time 24 fold in mice (Dennis et al, 2002 J Bil Chem 277(38):35035). This method is complicated by the dynamics of albumin recycle by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and the use of cysteine-constrained cyclic peptides for functionality. Alternatively, recombinant addition of large antibody fragments may be made to a protein drug. This may cause structural as well as manufacturing complications, e.g., because of the use of complex cyclic or large domains for functionality. Despite high affinity for albumin, they require the physical constraint of correctly forming a cyclic structure prior to use. Methods of fusing larger antibody fragments may not be amendable to proteins with an already complex folding structure or low expression yield.",
            "The potential of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, antibody-coupled T-cell receptor (ACTR) therapies and other adoptive T-cell therapies in effecting complete and durable responses has been demonstrated in a number of malignant and infectious diseases. The development of more potent T cells is limited, however, by safety concerns, highlighted by the occurrence of on-target and off-target toxicities that, although uncommon, have been fatal on occasions. Timely pharmacological intervention can be effective in the management of adverse events but adoptively transferred T cells can persist long term, along with any unwanted effects. T cells targeting differentiation antigens can be expected to also recognize nonmalignant cells that express the same antigens, resulting in adverse events. For example, melanoma patients treated with T cells targeting melanocyte differentiation antigens, such as MART-1 and gp100, often develop vitiligo and uveitis. These on-target toxicities have been observed across all forms of therapeutic approaches, including tumor-infiltrating cells, in vitro-expanded T-cell clones and TCR-transgenic cells. In general, on-target autoimmunity is associated with tumor regression and is more prominent in treatment approaches that are more efficacious. On-target but off-tumour toxicities can be immediately life-threatening. For example, patients with colorectal cancer with lung and liver metastases may develop respiratory distress within 15 min of HER2-specific CAR T-cell infusion and may subsequently die from multiorgan failure 5 days later. As T-cell therapy becomes more effective, acute toxicities have also become more evident. Cytokine release syndrome, which is characterized by fevers, rigors, hypotension and hypoxia, has been observed in a number of CD19 CAR T-cell studies as a result of large-scale T-cell activation upon the recognition of CD19+ malignant cells.",
            "There is an ongoing need to provide therapeutic compositions through the circulatory system that alleviate or prevent such diseases and conditions. There is a further a need for methods and compositions that increase the half-life, safety profile, and/or efficacy of such therapeutic compositions.

            "Presently, CHIKV is a re-emerging human pathogen that has now established itself in Southeast Asia and has more recently spread to Europe. The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was introduced into Asia around 1958, and sites of endemic transmission within Southeastern Asia, including the Indian Ocean, were observed through 1996. The CHIKV epidemic moved throughout Asia, reaching Europe and Africa in the early 2000s, and was imported via travelers to North America and South America from 2005 to 2007. Sporadic outbreaks are still occurring in several countries, such as Italy, inflicting naive populations. Singapore, for instance, experienced two successive waves of Chikungunya virus outbreaks in January and August 2008. Of the two strain lineages of CHIKV, the African strain remains enzootic by cycling between mosquitoes and monkeys, but the Asian strain is transmitted directly between mosquitoes and humans. This cycle of transmission may have allowed the virus to become more pathogenic as the reservoir host was eliminated.",

It is transmitted to humans through  (formerly  ) mosquito vectors and is mainly found in the tropical and semitropical areas of the world, where it is endemic in Asia, the Pacific region, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The incidence of infections has increased 30-fold over the last 50 years (WHO,  (2009)) and Dengue virus is the second most common tropical infectious disease worldwide after malaria.",
            "There is no specific treatment for DENV infection, and control of DENV by vaccination has proved elusive, in part, because the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS is not completely understood. While infection with one serotype confers lifelong homotypic immunity, it confers only short term (approximately three to six months) cross protection against heterotypic serotypes. Also, there is evidence that prior infection with one type can produce an antibody response that can intensify, or enhance, the course of disease during a subsequent infection with a different serotype. The possibility that vaccine components could elicit enhancing antibody responses, as opposed to protective responses, has been a major concern in designing and testing vaccines to protect against dengue infections.",
            "In late 2015 and early 2016, the first dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV) by Sanofi Pasteur, was registered in several countries for use in individuals 9-45 years of age living in endemic areas. Issues with the vaccine include (1) weak protection against DENV1 and DENV2 (<60% efficacy); (2) relative risk of dengue hospitalization among children <9 years old (7.5x higher than placebo); (3) immunogenicity not sustained after 1-2 years (implying the need for a 4 dose booster); and (4) lowest efficacy against DENV2, which often causes more severe conditions. This latter point is a major weakness with the Dengvaxia vaccine, signaling the need of a new, more effective vaccine effective against DENV2. Other tetravalent live-attenuated vaccines are under development in phase II and phase III clinical trials, and other vaccine candidates (based on subunit, DNA and purified inactivated virus platforms) are at earlier stages of clinical development, although the ability of these vaccine candidates to provide broad serotype protection has not been demonstrated.",

            "Various approaches have been proposed to overcome allogeneic rejection of transplanted or engrafted cells including HLA-matching, blocking pathways that trigger T-cell activation with antibodies, use of a cocktail of immune suppressive drugs, and autologous cell therapy. Another strategy to dampen graft rejection involves minimization of allogenic differences between transplanted or engrafted cells and the recipient. The cell surface-expressed human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), molecules encoded by genes located in the human major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6, are the major mediators of immune rejection. Mismatch of a single HLA gene between the donor and subject can cause a robust immune response (Fleischhauer K. et al. \u201cBone marrow-allograft rejection by T lymphocytes recognizing a single amino acid difference in HLA-B44,\u201d N Engl J Med., 1990, 323:1818-1822). HLA genes are divided into MHC class I (MHC-I) and MHC class II (MHC-II). MHC-I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) are expressed in almost all tissue cell types, presenting \u201cnon-self\u201d antigen-74150572.1 processed peptides to CD8+ T cells, thereby promoting their activation to cytolytic CD8+ T cells. Transplanted or engrafted cells expressing \u201cnon-self\u201d MHC-I molecules will cause a robust cellular immune response directed at these cells and ultimately resulting in their demise by activated cytolytic CD8+ T cells. MHC-I proteins are intimately associated with beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for forming functional MHC-I molecules on the cell surface.",
            "In contrast to the wide cellular expression of MHC-I genes, expression of MHC-II genes is restricted to antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. HLA antigen genes are the most polymorphic genes observed in the human genome (Rubinstein P., \u201cHLA matching for bone marrow transplantation\u2014how much is enough?\u201d N Engl J Med., 2001, 345:1842-1844). The generation of a \u201cuniversal donor\u201d cell that is compatible with any HLA genotype provides an alternative strategy that could resolve the immune rejection and associated economical costs of current methodologies for immune evasion.",
            "To generate such a line of universal donor cell(s), one previous approach has been to functionally disrupt the expression of MHC-I and MHC-II class genes. This could be achieved through genetic disruption, e.g., of both genetic alleles encoding the MHC-I light chain, B2M. The resulting B2M KO cell line and its derivatives would be expected to exhibit greatly reduced surface MHC-I and thus, reduced immunogenicity to allogeneic CD8+ T cells. The transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) targeting approach has been used to generate B2M-deficient hESC lines by deletion of a few nucleotides in exon 2 of the B2M gene (Lu, P. et al., \u201cGenerating hypoimmunogenic human embryonic stem cells by the disruption of beta 2-microglobulin,\u201d Stem Cell Rev. 2013, 9:806-813). Although the B2M-targeted hESC lines appeared to be surface HLA-I deficient, they were found to still contain mRNAs specific for B2M and MHC-I. The B2M and MHC-I mRNAs were expressed at levels equivalent to those of untargeted hESCs (both constitutive and IFN-g induced). Thus, concern exists that these TALEN B2M-targeted hESC lines might express residual cell surface MHC-I that would be sufficient to cause immune rejection, such as has been observed with B2M2/2 mouse cells that also express B2M mRNA (Gross, R. and Rappuoli, R. \u201cPertussis toxin promoter sequences involved in modulation,\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci, 1993, 90:3913-3917). Although the TALEN B2M targeted hESC lines were not examined for off-target cleavage events, the occurrence of nonspecific cleavage when using TALENs remains a significant issue that would impose a major safety concern on their clinical use (Grau, J. et al. \u201cTALENoffer: genome-wide TALEN off-target prediction,\u201d Bioinformatics, 2013, 29:2931-2932; Guilinger J. P. et al. \u201cBroad specificity profiling of TALENs results in engineered nucleases with improved DNA-cleavage specificity,\u201d Nat Methods 2014, 11:429-435). Further, another report generated IPS cells that escaped allogeneic recognition by knocking out a first B2M allele and knocking in a HLA-E gene at a second B2M allele, which resulted in surface expression of HLA-E dimers or trimers in the absence of surface expression of HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C (Gornalusse, G. G. et al., \u201cHLA-E-expressing pluripotent stem cells escape allogeneic responses and lysis by NK cells,\u201d Nature Biotechnology, 2017, 35, 765-773).",
            "A potential limitation of some of the above strategies are that MHC class I-negative cells are susceptible to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells as HLA molecules serve as major ligand inhibitors to natural killer (NK) cells. Host NK cells have been shown to eliminate transplanted or engrafted B2M\u2212/\u2212 donor cells, and a similar phenomenon occurs in vitro with MHC class-I-negative human leukemic lines (Bix, M. et al., \u201cRejection of class I MHC-deficient haemopoietic cells by irradiated MHC-matched mice,\u201d Nature, 1991, 349, 329-331; Zarcone, D. et al., \u201cHuman leukemia-derived cell lines and clones as models for mechanistic analysis of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity,\u201d Cancer Res. 1987, 47, 2674-2682). Thus, there exists a need to improve upon previous methods to generate universal donor cells that can evade the immune response as well as a need to generate cells that can survive post-engraftment. As described herein, cell survival post-engraftment may be mediated by a host of other pathways independent of allogeneic rejection e.g., hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress.

            "Natural Killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes involved in the innate immune response. Due to their function, NK cells are becoming cells of interest for use in the treatment of different diseases such as cancer. Recent success in editing immune cells (e.g. CART cells) for enhanced therapeutic ability prompts the use of NK cells in further therapy discoveries. Unfortunately, differentiating natural killer cells is typically a low output 5 to 6-week process. Additionally, current methods require feeder cells and cell sorting which adds additional time and cost for generating the cells. Accordingly, methods of differentiation are needed that reduce the cost, increase cell output, and reduce the time needed to generate NK cells. Improving upon these methods will allow for efficient output of NK cells and NK cell therapy for use in treating disease."

        "abstract": "This disclosure relates mRNA therapy for the treatment of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD). mRNAs for use in the invention, when administered in vivo, encode human ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), isoforms thereof, functional fragments thereof, and fusion proteins comprising OTC. mRNAs of the invention are preferably encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to effect efficient delivery to cells and/or tissues in subjects, when administered thereto. mRNA therapies of the invention increase and/or restore deficient levels of OTC expression and/or activity in subjects. mRNA therapies of the invention further decrease levels of toxic ammonia associated with deficient OTC activity in subjects.",
        "paragraph": [
            "Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is a rare, X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) that eliminate or reduce OTC function. OTCD is responsible for nearly half of all inherited disorders that affect the urea cycle. Caldovic et al., J. Genet. Genomics 42(5):181-194 (2015). OTCD symptoms can vary substantially. OTC defects can cause hyperammonemic episodes. The toxic effects of ammonia in the brain can lead to recurrent vomiting, neurobehavioral changes, seizures, and even death. Most patients with OTCD are hemizygous males lacking or severely deficient for OTC in the liver, who present with acute hyperammonemia, ataxia, and lethargy within the first week following birth. Heterozygous females and males with partial defects in OTC can present with symptoms later in life, including in adulthood. OTCD is estimated to have a prevalence of about 1:62,000 to 1:77,000 in the United States.",
            "OTC is a mitochondrial urea cycle enzyme that catalyzes a reaction between carbamyl phosphate and ornithine to form citrulline and phosphate. This is essential for the conversion of ammonia, a neurotoxic product of protein catabolism, into non-toxic urea. Human OTC (NM_000531.5) encodes a protein (NP_000522.3) that is 354 amino acids in length. It is expressed in the liver, and localizes within the mitochondria and cytosol of cells. An N-terminal leader sequence is removed in the mitochondria, to form a 322 amino acid mature protein. OTC is a homotrimer with three active sites.",
            "OTC patients exhibit elevated levels of plasma ammonia, elevated plasma glutamine, low or absent plasma citrulline, and elevated urinary orotic acid. These biochemical markers can be used to distinguish OTCD from other urea cycle disorders. Treatment options are limited for OTCD, as there are no commercial therapeutics for the disease, and only liver transplantation is considered curative.",
            "In view of the significant problems associated with existing OTCD treatments, there is an unmet need for improved treatment for OTCD."

        "paragraph": [
            "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a genus of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae, in the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae. There are currently eight species in this genus, which have been identified and classified for different mammals, including humans, monkeys, and rodents. The most studied genus is human cytomegalovirus, also known as human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), which is widely distributed in the human population. Diseases associated with HHV-5 include mononucleosis and pneumonias. All herpesviruses share a characteristic ability to remain latent within the body over long periods of time. Although they may be found throughout the body, CMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands in humans and other mammals. Other CMV viruses are found in several mammal species, but species isolated from animals differ from HCMV in terms of genomic structure, and have not been reported to cause human disease.",
            "HCMV is endemic in most parts of the world. It is a ubiquitous large enveloped virus that infects 50 to 100% of the adult population worldwide. Although generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent hosts, HCMV infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised persons, such as infants following congenital or neonatal infections, transplant recipients, or AIDS patients.",
            "Primary infection normally results in subclinical disease after which the virus becomes latent, retaining the capacity to reactivate at a later time. The virus is transmitted through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk. In particular, individuals with undeveloped or compromised immunity are highly sensitive to infection by HCMV. It is estimated that at least 60% of the US population has been exposed to CMV, with a prevalence of more than 90% in high-risk groups (e.g., unborn babies whose mothers become infected with CMV during the pregnancy or people with HIV).",
            "In healthy individuals, HCMV typically causes an asymptomatic infection or produces mild, flulike symptoms. However, among two populations, HCMV is responsible for serious medical conditions. First, HCMV is a major cause of congenital defects in newborns infected in utero. Among congenitally infected newborns, 5-10% have major clinical symptoms at birth, such as microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, and hepatitis, as well as cytomegalic inclusion disease, which affects many tissues and organs including the central nervous system, liver, and retina and can lead to multi-organ failure and death. Other infants may be asymptomatic at birth, but later develop hearing loss or central nervous system abnormalities causing, in particular, poor intellectual performance and mental retardation. These pathologies are due in part to the ability of HCMV to enter and replicate in diverse cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, neurons, and monocytes/macrophages.",
            "The second population at risk are immunocompromised patients, such as those suffering from HIV infection and those undergoing transplantations. In this situation, the virus becomes an opportunistic pathogen and causes severe disease with high morbidity and mortality. The clinical disease causes a variety of symptoms including fever, pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, myelitis, colitis, uveitis, retinitis, and neuropathy. Rarer manifestations of HCMV infections in immunocompetent individuals include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, meningoencephalitis, pericarditis, myocarditis, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. Moreover, HCMV infection increases the risk of organ graft loss through transplant vascular sclerosis and restenosis, and may increase atherosclerosis in transplant patients as well as in the general population. It is estimated that HCMV infection causes clinical disease in 75% of patients in the first year after transplantation.",
            "There is currently no approved HCMV vaccine. Two candidate vaccines, Towne and gB/MF59, have completed phase II efficacy trials. The Towne vaccine appears protective against both infection and disease caused by challenge with pathogenic Toledo strain and also appears to be effective in preventing severe post-transplantation CMV disease. However, in a small phase II clinical trial, a low dose of Towne vaccine failed to show protection against infection of seronegative mothers who had children actively shedding CMV.",
            "The gB/MF59 vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine comprised of a transmembrane-deleted version of HCMV gB protein, which induces high levels of fibroblast entry neutralizing antibodies in humans and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in both adults and toddlers. A recent phase II double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the gB/MF59 vaccine revealed a 50% efficacy in inducing sterilizing immunity. As this vaccine induces potent antibody responses but very weak T-cell responses, the partial efficacy provided by the vaccine is thought to be primarily antibody-mediated. While this HCMV vaccine is the first to show any protective efficacy, its 50% protection falls short of the 80-90% desired for most vaccines.",
            "In addition, antibody therapy has been used to control HCMV infection in immunocompromised individuals and to reduce the pathological consequences of maternal-fetal transmission, although such therapy is usually not sufficient to eradicate the virus. HCMV immunoglobulins (Igs) have been administered to transplant patients in association with immunosuppressive treatments for prophylaxis of HCMV disease with mixed results. Antibody therapy has also been used to control brief infection and prevent disease in newborns. However, these products are plasma derivatives with relatively low potency and have to be administered by intravenous infusion at very high doses in order to deliver sufficient amounts of neutralizing antibodies.",
            "HCMV is the leading viral cause of neurodevelopmental abnormality and other birth defects in children and the costs to society are substantial. Although antiviral therapy is available, the treatment with antiviral agents is imperfect and development of a CMV vaccine is the most promising strategy for preventing CMV infection. Given that the health and economic benefits of effective HCMV vaccines are significant, the US Institute of Medicine and US National Vaccine Program Office has categorized development of a CMV vaccine as a highest priority, but no candidate vaccine is under consideration for licensure."

            "There are many challenges associated with the delivery of nucleic acids to effect a desired response in a biological system. Nucleic acid based therapeutics have enormous potential but there remains a need for more effective delivery of nucleic acids to appropriate sites within a cell or organism in order to realize this potential. Therapeutic nucleic acids include, e.g., messenger RNA (mRNA), antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, DNAzymes, plasmids, immune stimulating nucleic acids, antagomir, antimir, mimic, supermir, and aptamers. Some nucleic acids, such as mRNA or plasmids, can be used to effect expression of specific cellular products as would be useful in the treatment of, for example, diseases related to a deficiency of a protein or enzyme. The therapeutic applications of translatable nucleotide delivery are extremely broad as constructs can be synthesized to produce any chosen protein sequence, whether or not indigenous to the system. The expression products of the nucleic acid can augment existing levels of protein, replace missing or non-functional versions of a protein, or introduce new protein and associated functionality in a cell or organism.",
            "Some nucleic acids, such as miRNA inhibitors, can be used to effect expression of specific cellular products that are regulated by miRNA as would be useful in the treatment of, for example, diseases related to deficiency of protein or enzyme. The therapeutic applications of miRNA inhibition are extremely broad as constructs can be synthesized to inhibit one or more miRNA that would in turn regulate the expression of mRNA products. The inhibition of endogenous miRNA can augment its downstream target endogenous protein expression and restore proper function in a cell or organism as a means to treat disease associated to a specific miRNA or a group of miRNA.",
            "Other nucleic acids can down-regulate intracellular levels of specific mRNA and, as a result, down-regulate the synthesis of the corresponding proteins through processes such as RNA interference (RNAi) or complementary binding of antisense RNA. The therapeutic applications of antisense oligonucleotide and RNAi are also extremely broad, since oligonucleotide constructs can be synthesized with any nucleotide sequence directed against a target mRNA. Targets may include mRNAs from normal cells, mRNAs associated with disease-states, such as cancer, and mRNAs of infectious agents, such as viruses. To date, antisense oligonucleotide constructs have shown the ability to specifically down-regulate target proteins through degradation of the cognate mRNA in both in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, antisense oligonucleotide constructs are currently being evaluated in clinical studies.",
            "However, two problems currently face using oligonucleotides in therapeutic contexts. First, free RNAs are susceptible to nuclease digestion in plasma. Second, free RNAs have limited ability to gain access to the intracellular compartment where the relevant translation machinery resides. Lipid nanoparticles formed from cationic lipids with other lipid components, such as neutral lipids, cholesterol, PEG, PEGylated lipids, and oligonucleotides have been used to block degradation of the RNAs in plasma and facilitate the cellular uptake of the oligonucleotides.",
            "There remains a need for improved cationic lipids and lipid nanoparticles for the delivery of oligonucleotides. Preferably, these lipid nanoparticles would provide optimal drug:lipid ratios, protect the nucleic acid from degradation and clearance in serum, be suitable for systemic delivery, and provide intracellular delivery of the nucleic acid. In addition, these lipid-nucleic acid particles should be well-tolerated and provide an adequate therapeutic index, such that patient treatment at an effective dose of the nucleic acid is not associated with unacceptable toxicity and/or risk to the patient. The present invention provides these and related advantages."

            "Interleukin-12 (IL12) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in innate and adaptive immunity. Gately, M K et al.,  16: 495-521 (1998). IL12 functions primarily as a 70 kDa heterodimeric protein consisting of two disulfide-linked p35 and p40 subunits. IL12 p40 homodimers do exist, but other than functioning as an antagonist that binds the IL12 receptor, they do not appear to mediate a biologic response. Id. The precursor form of the IL12 p40 subunit (NM_002187; P29460; also referred to as IL12B, natural killer cell stimulatory factor 2, cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor 2) is 328 amino acids in length, while its mature form is 306 amino acids long. The precursor form of the IL12 p35 subunit (NM_000882; P29459; also referred to as IL12A, natural killer cell stimulatory factor 1, cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor 1) is 219 amino acids in length and the mature form is 197 amino acids long. Id. The genes for the IL12 p35 and p40 subunits reside on different chromosomes and are regulated independently of each other. Gately, M K et al.,  16: 495-521 (1998). Many different immune cells (e.g., dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and B cells) produce IL12 upon antigenic stimuli. The active IL12 heterodimer is formed following protein synthesis. Id.",
            "Due to its ability to activate both NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, IL12 protein has been studied as a promising anti-cancer therapeutic since 1994. See Nastala, C. L. et al.,  153: 1697-1706 (1994). But despite high expectations, early clinical studies did not yield satisfactory results. Lasek W. et al.,  63: 419-435, 424 (2014). Repeated administration of IL12, in most patients, led to adaptive response and a progressive decline of IL12-induced interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) levels in blood. Id. Moreover, while it was recognized that IL12-induced anti-cancer activity is largely mediated by the secondary secretion of IFN\u03b3, the concomitant induction of IFN-\u03b3 along with other cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1) or chemokines (IP-10 or MIG) by IL12 caused severe toxicity. Id.",
            "In addition to the negative feedback and toxicity, the marginal efficacy of the IL12 therapy in clinical settings may be caused by the strong immunosuppressive environment in humans. Id. To minimize IFN-\u03b3 toxicity and improve IL12 efficacy, scientists tried different approaches, such as different dose and time protocols for IL12 therapy. See Sacco, S. et al.,  90: 4473-4479 (1997); Leonard, J. P. et al.,  90: 2541-2548 (1997); Coughlin, C.

Nonetheless, these approaches have not significantly impacted patient survival. Kang, W. K., et al.,  12: 671-684 (2001).",
            "Currently, a number of IL12 clinical trials are on-going. Though these multiple clinical trials have been on-going for nearly 20 years since the first human clinical trial of IL12 in 1996, an FDA-approved IL12 product is still not available. Thus, there is a need in the art for an improved therapeutic approach for using IL12 to treat tumors."

The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was introduced into Asia around 1958, and sites of endemic transmission within Southeastern Asia, including the Indian Ocean, were observed through 1996. The CHIKV epidemic moved throughout Asia, reaching Europe and Africa in the early 2000s, and was imported via travelers to North America and South America from 2005 to 2007. Sporadic outbreaks are still occurring in several countries, such as Italy, inflicting naive populations. Singapore, for instance, experienced two successive waves of Chikungunya virus outbreaks in January and August 2008. Of the two strain lineages of CHIKV, the African strain remains enzootic by cycling between mosquitoes and monkeys, but the Asian strain is transmitted directly between mosquitoes and humans. This cycle of transmission may have allowed the virus to become more pathogenic as the reservoir host was eliminated.",
            "In humans, CHIKV causes a debilitating disease characterized by fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, rash, muscle pain and joint pain. Following the acute phase of the illness, patients develop severe chronic symptoms lasting from several weeks to months, including fatigue, incapacitating joint pain and polyarthritis.",

The incidence of infections has increased 30-fold over the last 50 years (WHO,  (2009)) and Dengue virus is the second most common tropical infectious disease worldwide after malaria.",
            "There is no specific treatment for DENV infection, and control of DENV by vaccination has proved elusive, in part, because the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS is not completely understood. While infection with one serotype confers lifelong homotypic immunity, it confers only short term (approximately three to six months) cross protection against heterotypic serotypes. Also, there is evidence that prior infection with one type can produce an antibody response that can intensify, or enhance, the course of disease during a subsequent infection with a different serotype. The possibility that vaccine components could elicit enhancing antibody responses, as opposed to protective responses, has been a major concern in designing and testing vaccines to protect against dengue infections.",
            "In late 2015 and early 2016, the first dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV) by Sanofi Pasteur, was registered in several countries for use in individuals 9-45 years of age living in endemic areas. Issues with the vaccine include (1) weak protection against DENV1 and DENV2 (<60% efficacy); (2) relative risk of dengue hospitalization among children <9 years old (7.5\u00d7 higher than placebo); (3) immunogenicity not sustained after 1-2 years (implying the need for a 4 dose booster); and (4) lowest efficacy against DENV2, which often causes more severe conditions. This latter point is a major weakness with the Dengvaxia vaccine, signaling the need of a new, more effective vaccine effective against DENV2. Other tetravalent live-attenuated vaccines are under development in phase II and phase III clinical trials, and other vaccine candidates (based on subunit, DNA and purified inactivated virus platforms) are at earlier stages of clinical development, although the ability of these vaccine candidates to provide broad serotype protection has not been demonstrated.",

Although they may be found throughout the body, CMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands in humans and other mammals. Other CMV viruses are found in several mammal species, but species isolated from animals differ from HCMV in terms of genomic structure, and have not been reported to cause human disease.",
            "HCMV is endemic in most parts of the world. It is a ubiquitous large enveloped virus that infects 50 to 100% of the adult population worldwide. Although generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent hosts, HCMV infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised persons, such as infants following congenital or neonatal infections, transplant recipients, or AIDS patients.",
            "Primary infection normally results in subclinical disease after which the virus becomes latent, retaining the capacity to reactivate at a later time. The virus is transmitted through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk. In particular, individuals with undeveloped or compromised immunity are highly sensitive to infection by HCMV. It is estimated that at least 60% of the US population has been exposed to CMV, with a prevalence of more than 90% in high-risk groups (e.g., unborn babies whose mothers become infected with CMV during the pregnancy or people with HIV).",
            "In healthy individuals, HCMV typically causes an asymptomatic infection or produces mild, flulike symptoms. However, among two populations, HCMV is responsible for serious medical conditions. First, HCMV is a major cause of congenital defects in newborns infected in utero. Among congenitally infected newborns, 5-10% have major clinical symptoms at birth, such as microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, and hepatitis, as well as cytomegalic inclusion disease, which affects many tissues and organs including the central nervous system, liver, and retina and can lead to multi-organ failure and death. Other infants may be asymptomatic at birth, but later develop hearing loss or central nervous system abnormalities causing, in particular, poor intellectual performance and mental retardation. These pathologies are due in part to the ability of HCMV to enter and replicate in diverse cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, neurons, and monocytes/macrophages.",
            "The second population at risk are immunocompromised patients, such as those suffering from HIV infection and those undergoing transplantations. In this situation, the virus becomes an opportunistic pathogen and causes severe disease with high morbidity and mortality. The clinical disease causes a variety of symptoms including fever, pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, myelitis, colitis, uveitis, retinitis, and neuropathy. Rarer manifestations of HCMV infections in immunocompetent individuals include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, meningoencephalitis, pericarditis, myocarditis, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. Moreover, HCMV infection increases the risk of organ graft loss through transplant vascular sclerosis and restenosis, and may increase atherosclerosis in transplant patients as well as in the general population. It is estimated that HCMV infection causes clinical disease in 75% of patients in the first year after transplantation.",
            "There is currently no approved HCMV vaccine. Two candidate vaccines, Towne and gB/MF59, have completed phase II efficacy trials. The Towne vaccine appears protective against both infection and disease caused by challenge with pathogenic Toledo strain and also appears to be effective in preventing severe post-transplantation CMV disease. However, in a small phase II clinical trial, a low dose of Towne vaccine failed to show protection against infection of seronegative mothers who had children actively shedding CMV.",
            "The gB/MF59 vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine comprised of a transmembrane-deleted version of HCMV gB protein, which induces high levels of fibroblast entry neutralizing antibodies in humans and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in both adults and toddlers. A recent phase II double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the gB/MF59 vaccine revealed a 50% efficacy in inducing sterilizing immunity. As this vaccine induces potent antibody responses but very weak T-cell responses, the partial efficacy provided by the vaccine is thought to be primarily antibody-mediated. While this HCMV vaccine is the first to show any protective efficacy, its 50% protection falls short of the 80-90% desired for most vaccines.",
            "In addition, antibody therapy has been used to control HCMV infection in immunocompromised individuals and to reduce the pathological consequences of maternal-fetal transmission, although such therapy is usually not sufficient to eradicate the virus. HCMV immunoglobulins (Igs) have been administered to transplant patients in association with immunosuppressive treatments for prophylaxis of HCMV disease with mixed results. Antibody therapy has also been used to control congenital infection and prevent disease in newborns. However, these products are plasma derivatives with relatively low potency and have to be administered by intravenous infusion at very high doses in order to deliver sufficient amounts of neutralizing antibodies.",
            "HCMV is the leading viral cause of neurodevelopmental abnormality and other birth defects in children and the costs to society are substantial. Although antiviral therapy is available, the treatment with antiviral agents is imperfect and development of a CMV vaccine is the most promising strategy for preventing CMV infection. Given that the health and economic benefits of effective HCMV vaccines are significant, the US Institute of Medicine and US National Vaccine Program Office has categorized development of a CMV vaccine as a highest priority, but no candidate vaccine is under consideration for licensure."

Also provided herein are formulations for stable, freeze dried bacterial extracts that when stored at room temperature retain at least about 70% protein synthesis activity compared to undried frozen bacterial extracts.",
        "paragraph": [
            "The use of bacterial extracts for generating proteins of interest in cell free protein synthesis reactions (CFPS) has been expanding from a laboratory scale to commercial scale. There is a continuing need to make the process more economical. A part of this need includes improved methods for storing and stabilizing bacterial extracts. Prior art methods included the use of various additives; freezing and thawing; spray-drying or conventional lyophilization. Drying bacterial extract has obvious advantages of reduced volume but typically resulted in significant reduction in the ability of the extracts to generate the proteins of interest.",
            "In conventional freeze-drying (lyophilization) of bacterial extracts, vacuum pressure lowers the boiling temperature of water in the extract and enables the bacterial extracts to be dried at a lower temperature. The process reduces thermal degradation, relative to higher temperature drying procedures. Typically, a pressure gradient is created within the extract, driving mass transfer as vaporization occurs, and increasing heat transfer such that a heat gradient forms. Due to the heat gradient, outer portions of the sample tend to dry first, causing the surface layer to become more isolating for interior regions of the material and preventing more rapid heat transfer. Conventional lyophilization can lower the viability of biologically-active materials in bacterial extracts.",
            "In situ vaporization provides an expansive force in the sample as water vapor escapes, maintaining a more porous structure with increased surface area for sublimation. Microwave radiation in a vacuum chamber (radiant energy vacuum) is used to remove water to dehydrate biological materials (e.g., proteins, enzymes, nucleic acids, macromolecules, etc.). In some cases, biological material is frozen at low temperature in a vacuum chamber and radiant energy applied, such that the ice in the material is sublimated. In other cases the biological material is frozen prior to entering the vacuum chamber. This microwave radiation sublimation process prevents damage to temperature-sensitive biological materials from elevated temperatures and increases the drying rate and decreases drying times, relative to conventional freeze-drying procedures.",

Also provided are methods for reducing RF1 competition at an amber codon in the cell free synthesis system, and methods for expressing a protein in the cell free synthesis system. The modified proteins of the invention can be used to increase the yield of proteins having non-natural amino acids incorporated at an amber codon.",
        "paragraph": [
            "The use of bacterial cell-free extracts for in vitro protein synthesis offers several advantages over conventional in vivo protein expression methods. Cell-free systems can direct most, if not all, of the metabolic resources of the cell towards the exclusive production of one protein. Moreover, the lack of a cell wall and membrane components in vitro is advantageous since it allows for control of the synthesis environment. However, the efficiency of cell-free extracts can be decreased by bacterial proteins that inhibit protein synthesis, either directly or indirectly. Thus, inactivation of undesirable proteins that decrease the efficiency of protein synthesis should increase the yield of desirable proteins in cell-free extracts. For example, the inactivation of proteins that decrease the efficiency of protein synthesis should increase the yield of polypeptides having non-native amino acids incorporated at a defined amino acid residue. The introduction of non-native amino acids (nnAA) into polypeptides is useful for increasing the biological diversity and function of proteins. One approach for producing polypeptides having a nnAA incorporated at a defined amino acid residue is to use an nnAA, aminoacylated orthogonal CUA containing tRNA for introduction of the nnAA into the nascent polypeptide at an amber (stop) codon during protein translation. However, the incorporation of nnAA at an amber codon can be inhibited by the native bacterial termination complex, which normally recognizes the stop codon and terminates translation. Release Factor 1 (RF1) is a termination complex protein that facilitates the termination of translation by recognizing the amber codon in an mRNA sequence. RF1 recognition of the amber stop codon can promote pre-mature truncation products at the site of non-native amino acid incorporation, and thus decreased protein yield. Therefore, attenuating the activity of RF1 may increase nnAA incorporation into recombinant proteins.",
            "It has previously been shown that nnAA incorporation can be increased by attenuating RF1 activity in 3 ways: 1) neutralizing antibody inactivation of RF1, 2) genomic knockout of RF1 (in an RF2 bolstered strain), and 3) site specific removal of RF1 using a strain engineered to express RF1 containing a protein tag for removal by affinity chromatography (Chitin Binding Domain and His Tag). The present disclosure describes a novel method for inactivating RF1 by introducing proteolytic cleavage sites into the RF1 amino acid sequence. The cleavage sites are not accessible to the protease during bacterial cell growth, but are cleaved by the protease when the bacterial cells are lysed to produce cell-free extract. Thus, the yield of full length polypeptides having a nnAA incorporated at an amber codon is increased in bacterial cell extracts expressing modified RF1 variants described herein."

            "Zika virus (ZIKV) was identified in 1947 from a sentinel Rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda. Historically, ZIKV circulated between  species mosquitoes, non-human primates in the jungle, and episodically spilled into human populations in Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. Infection was associated with a mild, self-limiting febrile illness characterized by headache, rash, conjunctivitis, myalgia, and arthralgia. Since 2010, and especially in the context of its spread and dissemination to countries of the Western Hemisphere, more severe clinical consequences have been observed. Infection of fetuses in utero during pregnancy, particularly during the first and second trimesters, has been associated with placental insufficiency and congenital malformations including cerebral calcifications, microcephaly, and miscarriage. In adults, ZIKV infection is linked to an increased incidence of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disease characterized by paralysis and polyneuropathy. In addition to mosquito and in utero transmission, sexual transmission of ZIKV has been described from men-to-women, men-to-men, and women-to-men. Persistent ZIKV infection can occur, as viral RNA has been detected in semen, sperm, and vaginal secretions up to 6 months following infection. Thus, ZIKV is now a global disease with locally-acquired and travel-associated transmission through multiple routes in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. The emergence of ZIKV infection has prompted a global effort to develop safe and effective vaccines."

It is estimated that in the United States, most children are infected with RSV by the age of three. The RSV virion consists of an internal nucleocapsid comprised of the viral RNA bound to nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), and large polymerase protein (L). The nucleocapsid is surrounded by matrix protein (M) and is encapsulated by a lipid bilayer into which the viral fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins as well as the small hydrophobic protein (SH) are incorporated. The viral genome also encodes two nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2), which inhibit type I interferon activity as well as the M-2 protein.",

        "paragraph": [
            "Autologous and allogeneic immunotherapies are neoplasia treatment approaches in which immune cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors are administered to a subject. To generate an immune cell that expresses a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), the immune cell is first collected from the subject (autologous) or a donor separate from the subject receiving treatment (allogeneic) and genetically modified to express the chimeric antigen receptor. The resulting cell expresses the chimeric antigen receptor on its cell surface (e.g., CAR T-cell), and upon administration to the subject, the chimeric antigen receptor binds to the marker expressed by the neoplastic cell. This interaction with the neoplasia marker activates the CAR-T cell, which then cell kills the neoplastic cell. But for autologous or allogeneic cell therapy to be effective and efficient, significant conditions and cellular responses, such as T cell signaling inhibition, must be overcome or avoided. For allogeneic cell therapy, graft versus host disease and host rejection of CAR-T cells may provide additional challenges. Editing genes involved in these processes can enhance CAR-T cell function and resistance to immunosuppression or inhibition, but current methodologies for making such edits have the potential to induce large, genomic rearrangements in the CAR-T cell, thereby negatively impacting its efficacy. Thus, there is a significant need for techniques to more precisely modify immune cells, especially CAR-T cells. This application is directed to this and other important needs."

The universal donor cells comprise at least one genetic modification within or near a gene that encodes one or more MHC-I or MHC-II human leukocyte antigens or a component or a transcriptional regulator of a MHC-I or MHC-II complex, wherein genetic modification comprises an insertion of a polynucleotide encoding a tolerogenic factor and/or survival factor.

        "paragraph": [
            "Various approaches have been proposed to overcome allogeneic rejection of transplanted or engrafted cells including HLA-matching, blocking pathways that trigger T-cell activation with antibodies, use of a cocktail of immune suppressive drugs, and autologous cell therapy. Another strategy to dampen graft rejection involves minimization of allogenic differences between transplanted or engrafted cells and the recipient. The cell surface-expressed human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), molecules encoded by genes located in the human major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6, are the major mediators of immune rejection. Mismatch of a single HLA gene between the donor and subject can cause a robust immune response (Fleischhauer K. et al. \u201cBone marrow-allograft rejection by T lymphocytes recognizing a single amino acid difference in HLA-B44,\u201d N Engl J Med., 1990, 323:1818-1822). HLA genes are divided into MHC class I (MHC-I) and MHC class II (MHC-II). MHC-I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) are expressed in almost all tissue cell types, presenting \u201cnon-self\u201d antigen-processed peptides to CD8+ T cells, thereby promoting their activation to cytolytic CD8+ T cells. Transplanted or engrafted cells expressing \u201cnon-self\u201d MHC-I molecules will cause a robust cellular immune response directed at these cells and ultimately resulting in their demise by activated cytolytic CD8+ T cells. MHC-I proteins are intimately associated with beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for forming functional MHC-I molecules on the cell surface.",
            "In contrast to the wide cellular expression of MHC-I genes, expression of MHC-II genes is restricted to antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. HLA antigen genes are the most polymorphic genes observed in the human genome (Rubinstein P., \u201cHLA matching for bone marrow transplantation\u2014how much is enough?\u201d N Engl J Med., 2001, 345:1842-1844). The generation of a \u201cuniversal donor\u201d cell that is compatible with any HLA genotype provides an alternative strategy that could resolve the immune rejection and associated economical costs of current methodologies for immune evasion.",
            "To generate such a line of universal donor cell(s), one previous approach has been to functionally disrupt the expression of MHC-I and MHC-II class genes. This could be achieved through genetic disruption, e.g., of both genetic alleles encoding the MHC-I light chain, B2M. The resulting B2M-null cell line and its derivatives would be expected to exhibit greatly reduced surface MHC-I and thus, reduced immunogenicity to allogeneic CD8+ T cells. The transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) targeting approach has been used to generate B2M-deficient hESC lines by deletion of a few nucleotides in exon 2 of the B2M gene (Lu, P. et al., \u201cGenerating hypoimmunogenic human embryonic stem cells by the disruption of beta 2-microglobulin,\u201d Stem Cell Rev. 2013, 9:806-813). Although the B2M-targeted hESC lines appeared to be surface HLA-I deficient, they were found to still contain mRNAs specific for B2M and MHC-I. The B2M and MHC-I mRNAs were expressed at levels equivalent to those of untargeted hESCs (both constitutive and IFN-g induced). Thus, concern exists that these TALEN B2M-targeted hESC lines might express residual cell surface MHC-I that would be sufficient to cause immune rejection, such as has been observed with B2M2/2 mouse cells that also express B2M mRNA (Gross, R. and Rappuoli, R. \u201cPertussis toxin promoter sequences involved in modulation,\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci, 1993, 90:3913-3917). Although the TALEN B2M targeted hESC lines were not examined for off-target cleavage events, the occurrence of nonspecific cleavage when using TALENs remains a significant issue that would impose a major safety concern on their clinical use (Grau, J. et al. \u201cTALENoffer: genome-wide TALEN off-target prediction,\u201d Bioinformatics, 2013, 29:2931-2932; Guilinger J. P. et al. \u201cBroad specificity profiling of TALENs results in engineered nucleases with improved DNA-cleavage specificity,\u201d Nat Methods 2014, 11:429-435). Further, another report generated IPS cells that escaped allogeneic recognition by knocking out a first B2M allele and knocking in a HLA-E gene at a second B2M allele, which resulted in surface expression of HLA-E dimers or trimers in the absence of surface expression of HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C (Gornalusse, G. G. et al., \u201cHLA-E-expressing pluripotent stem cells escape allogeneic responses and lysis by NK cells,\u201d Nature Biotechnology, 2017, 35, 765-773).",
            "A potential limitation of some of the above strategies is that MHC class I-negative cells are susceptible to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells as HLA molecules serve as major ligand inhibitors to natural killer (NK) cells. Host NK cells have been shown to eliminate transplanted or engrafted B2M\u2212/\u2212 donor cells, and a similar phenomenon occurs in vitro with MHC class-I-negative human leukemic lines (Bix, M. et al., \u201cRejection of class I MHC-deficient haemopoietic cells by irradiated MHC-matched mice,\u201d Nature, 1991, 349, 329-331; Zarcone, D. et al., \u201cHuman leukemia-derived cell lines and clones as models for mechanistic analysis of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity,\u201d Cancer Res. 1987, 47, 2674-2682). Thus, there exists a need to improve upon previous methods to generate universal donor cells that can evade the immune response as well as a need to generate cells that can survive post-engraftment. As described herein, cell survival post-engraftment or post-transplantation may be mediated by a host of other pathways independent of allogeneic rejection e.g., hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress. Also as described herein, genetic introduction of survival factors (genes and/or proteins) may help cells to survive post-engraftment. As described herein, a universal donor cell line may combine properties that address both allogeneic rejection and survival post-engraftment."

Gene therapy to deliver functional Mecp2 or using RNA editing to repair the endogenous Mecp2 (MECP2) mRNA transcripts are promising approaches to therapeutic interventions when delivered broadly throughout the CNS. However, both approaches must overcome significant challenges to achieve therapeutic efficacy. Mecp2 gene therapy must tightly control the dosage of the delivered gene on a per-cell basis or risk mimicking the phenotype of Mecp2 duplication syndrome. RNA editing platforms are unable to precisely correct the most prevalent Mecp2 mutations accounting for more than 45% of RTT diagnoses and also induce efficient, unguided off-target editing.",
            "The genetic mutations in Mecp2 that cause Rett Syndrome (RTT) are highly heterogeneous. As a consequence, the favored strategy for therapy has been to deliver wild-type Mecp2 carried by recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). Because this strategy is agnostic to the causal mutation in each individual, a successful gene therapy approach would provide a therapeutic option to a large portion of the RTT patient population. To date, however, this strategy has been met with limited success. RTT patients are nearly always heterozygotic females, resulting in characteristic wild-type and mutant X-linked MeCP2 mosaic expression within the central nervous system (CNS) due to random X-chromosome inactivation. Thus, rAAV delivery and expression of wild-type MeCP2 in neurons already expressing wild-type MeCP2 is likely to partially mimic the phenotype of MeCP2 duplication syndrome. Consistent with this, high transduction efficiency in the CNS of RTT-model mice resulted in approximately 2-fold greater MeCP2 expression than found in wild-type mice.",

With changes in the environment, human behavior and habitat, increasingly these infections are emerging from wildlife species. Specific examples of zoonotic viruses include Lassa virus, Nipah virus, and betacoronaviruses.",
            "Lassa Virus. Lassa virus (LASV), a segmented negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the family Arenaviridae, is endemic to West Africa. Transmission typically occurs through contact with infected rodents or virus-contaminated rodent excreta, and person-to-person transmission. The LASV expresses just one protein on its surface, termed GPC, which mediates both attachment to and entry of host cells. GPC is a class I viral fusion protein that forms trimers on the viral surface. Each monomer in the trimer is assembled by distinct GP1 and GP2 subunits that mediate receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively. Notably, on the viral surface, GP2 is coiled about the base of GP1 in a structure that is only metastable. The complex is prone to rapid disassembly of GP1 from GP2 and rearrangement of the GP2 into a much more stable six-helix bundle. The release of energy achieved by collapsing of the metastable viral-surface conformation to the much more stable six-helix bundle conformation drives fusion of viral and host membranes during infection. Because of its metastability, it is difficult to maintain GPC on its trimeric pre-fusion configuration when expressed recombinantly or even when expressed on some particle surfaces. Antibodies against the resulting separated subunits are not potently neutralizing. As a result, prior vaccine approaches that included natural GPC failed to elicit an effective antibody response, leading vaccine manufacturers to instead focus on induction of cell-mediated immunity as the most likely correlate of protection. Further, in the absence of knowledge about how to create or purify stabilized Lassa virus GPC trimeric, vaccine makers did not have the necessary reagents to evaluate the most ideal antibody responses.",
            "The structure of the viral surface GP trimer remained unknown for Lassa and all other arenaviruses until this year.

        "abstract": "The present disclosure relates to artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs), in particular engineered erythroid cells and enucleated cells (e.g. enucleated erythroid cells and platelets), that are engineered to activate or suppress T cells.",
        "paragraph": [
            "Active immune responses depend on efficient presentation of antigens and co-stimulatory signals by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Upon internalization of an antigen, the APCs can display antigen-class I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the membrane together with co-stimulatory signals to activate antigen-specific T cells, which play a key role in the adaptive immune response. In vivo, induction of T cell responses is highly dependent on interactions with professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), in particular dendritic cells (DCs), which present, for example, tumor-specific antigens. Generally, antigen-specific T cells can be primed and amplified ex vivo before they are transferred back to the patient. For example, in adoptive cell transfer (ACT), tumor-specific T cells are isolated then expanded ex vivo to obtain a large number of cells for transfusion. As one of the APCs, dendritic cells (DCs) are usually used to maximize T cell stimulation ex vivo. However, the use of natural APCs, such as DCs, has been met with certain challenges, including lack of knowledge of the optimal antigen-loaded DC, and mixed results have been found in clinical trials (Steenblock E. R. et al., Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2009; 9: 451-464; Melief C M J Immunity. 2008; 29: 372-383; Palucka K. and Banchereau J. Immunity. 2013; 39: 38-48). In addition, isolation and ex vivo stimulation of autologous DCs is time-consuming and expensive, and the quality of ex vivo-generated DCs can be variable (Steenblock E. R. et al. 2009; Kim J. V. et al. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 403-410). The use of patient-derived autologous DCs therefore limits standardization of DC-based treatment protocols (Steenblock E. R. et al. 2009; Kim J. V. et al. 2004).",
            "Artificial APCs (aAPCs) are engineered platforms for T cell activation and expansion that aim to avoid the aforementioned obstacles while mimicking the interaction between DCs and T cells. They include multiple systems, including synthetic biomaterials that have been engineered to activate and/or expand desirable immune cell populations (e.g., T cells). These systems may act by mimicking the interaction between DCs and T cells. For instance, several cell-sized, rigid, beads, such as latex microbeads, polystyrene-coated magnetic microbeads and biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microparticles, have been developed. The efficacy of these beads in inducing activation and/or expansion of immune cells appears to be highly dependent on the properties of the materials used. For example, beads greater than 200 nm are typically retained at the site of inoculation, while smaller particles may be taken up by DCs (see, e.g., Reddy et al. (2006)  112: 26-34). In contrast, the membrane of natural APCs is much more dynamic than the outer surface of these beads.",
            "There remains a need to provide improved ways to stimulate T cells and to promulgate sufficient numbers of therapeutic T cells for adoptive immunotherapy. The present invention provides novel and inventive red cell therapeutics (RCTs), specifically aAPCs to mimic the functions of APCs, such as dendritic cells (DCs), to stimulate T cells and induce, for example, antitumor or infectious disease immune responses, or to suppress T cell activity to prevent, for example, autoimmune disorders."

            "Interleukin-12 (IL12) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in innate and adaptive immunity. Gately, M K et al.,  16: 495-521 (1998). IL12 functions primarily as a 70 kDa heterodimeric protein consisting of two disulfide-linked p35 and p40 subunits. IL12 p40 homodimers do exist, but other than functioning as an antagonist that binds the IL12 receptor, they do not appear to mediate a biologic response. Id. The precursor form of the IL12 p40 subunit (NM_002187; P29460; also referred to as IL12B, natural killer cell stimulatory factor 2, cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor 2) is 328 amino acids in length, while its mature form is 306 amino acids long. The precursor form of the IL12 p35 subunit (NM_000882; P29459; also referred to as IL12A, natural killer cell stimulatory factor 1, cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor 1) is 219 amino acids in length and the mature form is 197 amino acids long. Id. The genes for the IL12 p35 and p40 subunits reside on different chromosomes and are regulated independently of each other. Gately, M K et al.,  16: 495-521 (1998). Many different immune cells (e.g., dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and B cells) produce IL12 upon antigenic stimuli. The active IL12 heterodimer is formed following protein synthesis. Id.",
            "Due to its ability to activate both NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, IL12 protein has been studied as a promising anti-cancer therapeutic since 1994. See Nastala, C. L. et al.,  153: 1697-1706 (1994). But despite high expectations, early clinical studies did not yield satisfactory results. Lasek W. et al.,  63: 419-435, 424 (2014). Repeated administration of IL12, in most patients, led to adaptive response and a progressive decline of IL12-induced interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) levels in blood. Id. Moreover, while it was recognized that IL12-induced anti-cancer activity is largely mediated by the secondary secretion of IFN\u03b3, the concomitant induction of IFN-\u03b3 along with other cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1) or chemokines (IP-10 or MIG) by IL12 caused severe toxicity. Id.",
            "In addition to the negative feedback and toxicity, the marginal efficacy of the IL12 therapy in clinical settings may be caused by the strong immunosuppressive environment in humans. Id. To minimize IFN-\u03b3 toxicity and improve IL12 efficacy, scientists tried different approaches, such as different dose and time protocols for IL12 therapy. See Sacco, S. et al.,  90: 4473-4479 (1997); Leonard, J. P. et al.,  90: 2541-2548 (1997); Coughlin, C.

Nonetheless, these approaches have not significantly impacted patient survival. Kang, W. K., et al.,  12: 671-684 (2001).",
            "Currently, a number of IL12 clinical trials are on-going. Though these multiple clinical trials have been on-going for nearly 20 years since the first human clinical trial of IL12 in 1996, an FDA-approved IL12 product is still not available. Thus, there is a need in the art for an improved therapeutic approach for using IL12 to treat tumors."

            "Various approaches have been proposed to overcome allogeneic rejection of transplanted or engrafted cells including HLA-matching, blocking pathways that trigger T-cell activation with antibodies, use of a cocktail of immune suppressive drugs, and autologous cell therapy. Another strategy to dampen graft rejection involves minimization of allogenic differences between transplanted or engrafted cells and the recipient. The cell surface-expressed human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), molecules encoded by genes located in the human major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6, are the major mediators of immune rejection. Mismatch of a single HLA gene between the donor and subject can cause a robust immune response (Fleischhauer K. et al. \u201cBone marrow-allograft rejection by T lymphocytes recognizing a single amino acid difference in HLA-B44,\u201d N Engl J Med., 1990, 323:1818-1822). HLA genes are divided into MHC class I (MHC-I) and MHC class II (MHC-II). MHC-I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) are expressed in almost all tissue cell types, presenting \u201cnon-self\u201d antigen-processed peptides to CD8+ T cells, thereby promoting their activation to cytolytic CD8+ T cells. Transplanted or engrafted cells expressing \u201cnon-self\u201d MHC-I molecules will cause a robust cellular immune response directed at these cells and ultimately resulting in their demise by activated cytolytic CD8+ T cells. MHC-I proteins are intimately associated with beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for forming functional MHC-I molecules on the cell surface.",
            "In contrast to the wide cellular expression of MHC-I genes, expression of MHC-II genes is restricted to antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. HLA antigen genes are the most polymorphic genes observed in the human genome (Rubinstein P., \u201cHLA matching for bone marrow transplantation\u2014how much is enough?\u201d N Engl J Med., 2001, 345:1842-1844). The generation of a \u201cuniversal donor\u201d cell that is compatible with any HLA genotype provides an alternative strategy that could resolve the immune rejection and associated economical costs of current methodologies for immune evasion.",
            "To generate such a line of universal donor cell(s), one previous approach has been to functionally disrupt the expression of MHC-I and MHC-II class genes. This could be achieved through genetic disruption, e.g., of both genetic alleles encoding the MHC-I light chain, B2M. The resulting B2M-null cell line and its derivatives would be expected to exhibit greatly reduced surface MHC-I and thus, reduced immunogenicity to allogeneic CD8+ T cells. The transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) targeting approach has been used to generate B2M-deficient hESC lines by deletion of a few nucleotides in exon 2 of the B2M gene (Lu, P. et al., \u201cGenerating hypoimmunogenic human embryonic stem cells by the disruption of beta 2-microglobulin,\u201d Stem Cell Rev. 2013, 9:806-813). Although the B2M-targeted hESC lines appeared to be surface HLA-I deficient, they were found to still contain mRNAs specific for B2M and MHC-I. The B2M and MHC-I mRNAs were expressed at levels equivalent to those of untargeted hESCs (both constitutive and IFN-g induced). Thus, concern exists that these TALEN B2M-targeted hESC lines might express residual cell surface MHC-I that would be sufficient to cause immune rejection, such as has been observed with B2M2/2 mouse cells that also express B2M mRNA (Gross, R. and Rappuoli, R. \u201cPertussis toxin promoter sequences involved in modulation,\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci, 1993, 90:3913-3917). Although the TALEN B2M targeted hESC lines were not examined for off-target cleavage events, the occurrence of nonspecific cleavage when using TALENs remains a significant issue that would impose a major safety concern on their clinical use (Grau, J. et al. \u201cTALENoffer: genome-wide TALEN off-target prediction,\u201d Bioinformatics, 2013, 29:2931-2932; Guilinger J. P. et al. \u201cBroad specificity profiling of TALENs results in engineered nucleases with improved DNA-cleavage specificity,\u201d Nat Methods 2014, 11:429-435). Further, another report generated IPS cells that escaped allogeneic recognition by knocking out a first B2M allele and knocking in a HLA-E gene at a second B2M allele, which resulted in surface expression of HLA-E dimers or trimers in the absence of surface expression of HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C (Gornalusse, G. G. et al., \u201cHLA-E-expressing pluripotent stem cells escape allogeneic responses and lysis by NK cells,\u201d Nature Biotechnology, 2017, 35, 765-773).",
            "A potential limitation of some of the above strategies are that MHC class I-negative cells are susceptible to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells as HLA molecules serve as major ligand inhibitors to natural killer (NK) cells. Host NK cells have been shown to eliminate transplanted or engrafted B2M\u2212/\u2212 donor cells, and a similar phenomenon occurs in vitro with MHC class-I-negative human leukemic lines (Bix, M. et al., \u201cRejection of class I MHC-deficient haemopoietic cells by irradiated MHC-matched mice,\u201d Nature, 1991, 349, 329-331; Zarcone, D. et al., \u201cHuman leukemia-derived cell lines and clones as models for mechanistic analysis of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity,\u201d Cancer Res. 1987, 47, 2674-2682). Thus, there exists a need to improve upon previous methods to generate universal donor cells that can evade the immune response as well as a need to generate cells that can survive post-engraftment. As described herein, cell survival post-engraftment may be mediated by a host of other pathways independent of allogeneic rejection e.g., hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress. Also as described herein, genetic introduction of survival factors (genes and/or proteins) may help cells to survive post-engraftment. As described herein, a universal donor cell line may combine properties that address both allogeneic rejection and survival post-engraftment."

Genome engineering is an active field of research because of the wide range of possible applications, particularly in the area of human health, e.g., to correct a gene carrying a harmful mutation or to explore the function of a gene. Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion location of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disruption of normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unintended effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells.

Issues with the vaccine include (1) weak protection against DENV1 and DENV2 (<60% efficacy); (2) relative risk of dengue hospitalization among children <9 years old (7.5\u00d7 higher than placebo); (3) immunogenicity not sustained after 1-2 years (implying the need for a 4 dose booster); and (4) lowest efficacy against DENV2, which often causes more severe conditions. This latter point is a major weakness with the Dengvaxia vaccine, signaling the need of a new, more effective vaccine effective against DENV2. Other tetravalent live-attenuated vaccines are under development in phase II and phase III clinical trials, and other vaccine candidates (based on subunit, DNA and purified inactivated virus platforms) are at earlier stages of clinical development, although the ability of these vaccine candidates to provide broad serotype protection has not been demonstrated.",
            "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Flaviviridae virus family and the  genus. In humans, it causes a disease known as Zika fever. It is related to dengue, yellow fever, West Nile and Japanese encephalitis, viruses that are also members of the virus family Flaviviridae. ZIKV is spread to people through mosquito bites. The most common symptoms of ZIKV disease (Zika) are fever, rash, joint pain, and red eye. The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week. There is no vaccine to prevent, or medicine to treat, Zika virus.",
            "Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccination is one technique used to stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses to foreign antigens, such as ZIKV antigens. The direct injection of genetically engineered DNA (e.g., naked plasmid DNA) into a living host results in a small number of its cells directly producing an antigen, resulting in a protective immunological response. With this technique, however, comes potential problems, including the possibility of insertional mutagenesis, which could lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inhibition of tumor suppressor genes."

Also provided herein are base editor systems for editing nucleobases of target nucleotide sequences.",
        "paragraph": [
            "Rett Syndrome (RTT or RETT) is caused by a heterogeneous group of mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (Mecp2) gene that impair or abrogate the encoded protein's ability to modify chromatin and transcriptional states in the central nervous system (CNS). Gene therapy to deliver functional Mecp2 or using RNA editing to repair the endogenous Mecp2 mRNA transcripts are promising approaches to therapeutic interventions when delivered broadly throughout the CNS. However, both approaches must overcome significant challenges to achieve therapeutic efficacy. Mecp2 gene therapy must tightly control the dosage of the delivered gene on a per-cell basis or risk mimicking the phenotype of Mecp2 duplication syndrome. RNA editing platforms are unable to precisely correct the most prevalent Mecp2 mutations accounting for more than 45% of RTT diagnoses and also induce efficient, unguided off-target editing.",
            "The genetic mutations in Mecp2 that cause Rett Syndrome (RTT) are highly heterogeneous. As a consequence, the favored strategy for therapy has been to deliver wild-type Mecp2 carried by recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). Because this strategy is agnostic to the causal mutation in each individual, a successful gene therapy approach would provide a therapeutic option to a large portion of the RTT patient population. To date, however, this strategy has been met with limited success. RTT patients are nearly always heterozygotic females, resulting in characteristic wild-type and mutant X-linked MeCP2 mosaic expression within the central nervous system (CNS) due to random X-chromosome inactivation. Thus, rAAV delivery and expression of wild-type MeCP2 in neurons already expressing wild-type MeCP2 is likely to partially mimic the phenotype of MeCP2 duplication syndrome. Consistent with this, high transduction efficiency in the CNS of RTT-model mice resulted in approximately 2-fold greater MeCP2 expression than found in wild-type mice.",
            "Therefore, there is a need for novel compositions and methods for treating patients with Rett Syndrome.",

            "Genome engineering refers to strategies and techniques for the targeted, specific modification of the genetic information (genome) of living organisms. Genome engineering is an active field of research because of the wide range of possible applications, particularly in the area of human health, e.g., to correct a gene carrying a harmful mutation or to explore the function of a gene. Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion location of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disruption of normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unintended effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells. Common genome engineering strategies, such as ZFNs, TALENs, HEs, and MegaTALs, allow a specific area of the DNA to be modified, thereby increasing precision of the correction or insertion compared to earlier technologies. These platforms offer a greater degree of reproducibility, but limitations remain.",

            "There are multiple problems with prior methodologies of effecting protein expression. For example, introduced DNA can integrate into host cell genomic DNA at some frequency, resulting in alterations and/or damage to the host cell genomic DNA. Alternatively, the heterologous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) introduced into a cell can be inherited by daughter cells (whether or not the heterologous DNA has integrated into the chromosome) or by offspring. In addition, assuming proper delivery and no damage or integration into the host genome, there are multiple steps which must occur before the encoded protein is made. Once inside the cell, DNA must be transported into the nucleus where it is transcribed into RNA. The RNA transcribed from DNA must then enter the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. Not only do the multiple processing steps from administered DNA to protein create lag times before the generation of the functional protein, each step represents an opportunity for error and damage to the cell. Further, it is known to be difficult to obtain DNA expression in cells as DNA frequently enters a cell but is not expressed or not expressed at reasonable rates or concentrations. This can be a particular problem when DNA is introduced into primary cells or modified cell lines.",

            "Early work showed that incorporation of modified nucleosides, in particular, pseudouridine, reduced innate immune activation and increased translation of mRNA, but residual induction of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines remained (Kariko et al.

Progress was made towards the identification of the contaminants in nucleoside-modified IVT RNA identifying double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as being at lease partially responsible for innate immune activation. Removal of such contaminants by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) resulted in reduced IFN and inflammatory cytokine levels and in turn, higher expression levels in primary cells (Kariko et al.

The method purports to result in preparations having decreased levels of dsRNA and increased levels of intact ssRNA, as evidenced by higher levels of reprogramming factors and less toxicity to cells. Such methods, however, are not compatible for use in the preparation of mRNAs for therapeutic use, in particular, for human therapeutic use. RNAse III is known to digest ssRNA as well as dsRNA and in trying to remove dsRNA contaminants, the integrity of the desired ssRNA product is necessarily jeopardized. Thus, there exists a need for better understanding of the nature of contaminants in IVT-generated mRNA preparations, in order to better control for levels and nature of contaminants in IVT preparations. There further exists a need for improved methods of preparing mRNA for therapeutic use and for high purity compositions produced according to such methods."

            "HHC is characterized by excessive storage of iron in the liver, skin, pancreas, heart, joints, and testes. It remains the most common, identified, genetic disorder in Caucasians. Although its geographic distribution is worldwide, it is most common in populations of northern European origin, particularly Nordic or Celtic ancestry, in which it occurs with a prevalence of approximately 1 per 220-250 individuals. The pathophysiologic predisposition to increased, inappropriate absorption of dietary iron may lead to the development of life-threatening complications such as cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), diabetes, and heart disease.",
            "In 1996, HFE, a gene involved in HHC, was located on Chromosome 6 (6p21.3 region) and found to contain 7 exons spanning 12 kb.",
            "It was discovered that the HFE gene has multiple allelic variants. One known mutation is a G-to-A missense mutation leading to the substitution of tyrosine for cysteine at amino acid position 282 of the protein product (C282Y). C282Y homozygotes account for 80-85% of typical patients with HHC. Allele frequencies of HFE C282Y in ethnically diverse western European white populations are 5-14% and in North American non-Hispanic whites are 6-7%. C282Y exists as a polymorphism only in Western European white and derivative populations, although C282Y may have arisen independently in non-whites outside Europe. There are two other regularly identified mutations of the HFE gene, one in which aspartate is substituted for histidine at amino acid position 63 (H63D), and the other in which cysteine is substituted for serine at amino acid position 65 (S65C). These mutations are generally not associated with iron loading unless seen with C282Y as a compound heterozygote, C282Y/H63D or C282Y/S65C.",

These mutations of other genes coding for iron regulatory proteins are thought to account for most of the non-HFE forms of HHC.",
            "The largest predicted primary translation product of the HFE gene is 348 amino acids, which gives rise to a mature protein of approximately 321 amino acids after cleavage of the signal sequence. The HFE protein is similar to HLA Class I molecules at the level of the primary structure and tertiary structure. The mature protein is expressed on the cell surface as a heterodimer with beta-2-microglobulin, and this interaction is necessary for normal presentation on the cell surface. The C282Y pathogenic variant destroys a key cysteine residue that is required for disulfide bonding with beta-2-microglobulin. As a result, the HFE protein does not mature properly and becomes trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, leading to decreased cell-surface expression.",
            "The diagnosis of HHC in individuals is typically based on finding elevated transferrin-iron saturation 45% or higher and serum ferritin concentration above the upper limit of normal (i.e., >300 ng/mL in men and >200 ng/mL in women) and two pathogenic variants on confirmatory HFE molecular genetic testing. Although serum ferritin concentration may increase progressively over time in untreated individuals with HHC, it is not specific for HHC, and therefore cannot be used alone for identification of individuals with HHC.",

            "An alternative treatment for patients diagnosed with HHC includes genome engineering. Genome engineering refers to the strategies and techniques for the targeted, specific modification of the genetic information (genome) of living organisms. Genome engineering is a very active field of research because of the wide range of possible applications, particularly in the areas of human health; the correction of a gene carrying a harmful mutation, for example, or to explore the function of a gene. Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disrupting normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unwanted effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells. Recent genome engineering strategies, such as ZFNs, TALENs, HEs and MegaTALs, enable a specific area of the DNA to be modified, thereby increasing the precision of the correction or insertion compared to early technologies. These newer platforms offer a much larger degree of reproducibility, but still have their limitations.",

Nucleic acid based therapeutics have enormous potential but there remains a need for more effective delivery of nucleic acids to appropriate sites within a cell or organism in order to realize this potential. Therapeutic nucleic acids include, e.g., messenger RNA (mRNA), antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, DNAzymes, plasmids, immune stimulating nucleic acids, antagomir, antimir, mimic, supermir, and aptamers. Some nucleic acids, such as mRNA or plasmids, can be used to effect expression of specific cellular products as would be useful in the treatment of, for example, diseases related to a deficiency of a protein or enzyme. The therapeutic applications of translatable nucleotide delivery are extremely broad as constructs can be synthesized to produce any chosen protein sequence, whether or not indigenous to the system. The expression products of the nucleic acid can augment existing levels of protein, replace missing or non-functional versions of a protein, or introduce new protein and associated functionality in a cell or organism.",

The therapeutic applications of miRNA inhibition are extremely broad as constructs can be synthesized to inhibit one or more miRNA that would in turn regulate the expression of mRNA products. The inhibition of endogenous miRNA can augment its downstream target endogenous protein expression and restore proper function in a cell or organism as a means to treat disease associated to a specific miRNA or a group of miRNA.",
            "Other nucleic acids can down-regulate intracellular levels of specific mRNA and, as a result, down-regulate the synthesis of the corresponding proteins through processes such as RNA interference (RNAi) or complementary binding of antisense RNA. The therapeutic applications of antisense oligonucleotide and RNAi are also extremely broad, since oligonucleotide constructs can be synthesized with any nucleotide sequence directed against a target mRNA. Targets may include mRNAs from normal cells, mRNAs associated with disease-states, such as cancer, and mRNAs of infectious agents, such as viruses. To date, antisense oligonucleotide constructs have shown the ability to specifically down-regulate target proteins through degradation of the cognate mRNA in both in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, antisense oligonucleotide constructs are currently being evaluated in clinical studies.",
            "However, two problems currently face the use of oligonucleotides in therapeutic contexts. First, free RNAs are susceptible to nuclease digestion in plasma. Second, free RNAs have limited ability to gain access to the intracellular compartment where the relevant translation machinery resides. Lipid nanoparticles formed from cationic lipids with other lipid components, such as neutral lipids, cholesterol, PEG, PEGylated lipids, and oligonucleotides have been used to block degradation of the RNAs in plasma and facilitate the cellular uptake of the oligonucleotides.",
            "There remains a need for improved cationic lipids and lipid nanoparticles for the delivery of oligonucleotides. Preferably, these lipid nanoparticles would provide optimal drug:lipid ratios, protect the nucleic acid from degradation and clearance in serum, be suitable for systemic or local delivery, and provide intracellular delivery of the nucleic acid. In addition, these lipid-nucleic acid particles should be well-tolerated and provide an adequate therapeutic index, such that patient treatment at an effective dose of the nucleic acid is not associated with unacceptable toxicity and/or risk to the patient.

            "RNA polymerases exhibit three phases of transcription\u2014initiation, elongation and termination. During the initiation phase, the RNA polymerase binds to a specific promoter DNA sequence, opens the DNA duplex and feeds the template strand into the active site. T7 RNA polymerase, for example, forms a structure referred to as initiation complex, which includes a six-helix bundle sub-domain (the promoter binding domain) that interacts with the promoter to initiate DNA duplex melting. While bound to the promoter, the polymerase produces many short (truncated) transcripts from 2-12 nucleotides (nt) in length, a process often referred to as abortive synthesis/initiation. The truncated RNA transcripts cannot be converted to full-length transcripts by RNA polymerase and become by-products that accumulate during transcription. After the transition to the elongation phase and release of the promoter, the polymerase proceeds down the DNA template producing a full-length RNA transcript.",
            "During the elongation phase, RNA polymerase often continues to transcribe DNA beyond the point at which termination should be initiated, generating longer than expected RNA transcripts (\u201crun-on transcripts\u201d). T7 RNA polymerase, for example, adds nucleotides to the end of a transcript before \u2018falling off\u2019 the template. Studies suggest that more than 70% of transcripts generated by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro may be run-on transcripts. In some cases, these aberrant RNA products are twice the length of the encoded sequence. Because run-on transcription is stochastic, there is often great 3\u2032 heterogeneity among products in a given IVT reaction. This 3\u2032 heterogeneity is problematic for downstream applications, such as ligation reactions, which are dependent on RNA transcripts of a defined length and/or nucleotide composition."

            "Ribonucleic acids (RNA) play important roles in the regulation, coding, and expression of genes. Cellular organisms include many different kinds of RNA, each of which may perform a unique role within a biological system. Certain RNA molecules include a sequence of nucleotides including only adenine nucleobases. So-called poly(A) sequences (also known as poly(A) tails or regions) are thought to stabilize the RNA and to facilitate the termination of transcription, the export of the RNA from cellular regions such as the nucleus, and translation. An RNA having a poly(A) sequence may be a messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA molecules encode polypeptides and are responsible for gene expression. In recent years, RNA molecules having poly(A) sequences (e.g., mRNA) have been identified as potentially useful therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents for a variety of pharmaceutical applications. However, methods and apparatus for purifying such RNA molecules in high purity and yield are lacking. RNA having poly(A) sequences are often components of samples including substantial amounts of other kinds of RNA in addition to other contaminants. Further, current methods and apparatus for purifying RNA having poly(A) sequences may require large amounts of solvent. Thus, improved methods and apparatus for purifying RNA having poly(A) sequences on large and small scales with higher purity and higher yield and using less solvent are needed."

Once inside the cell, DNA must be transported into the nucleus where it is transcribed into RNA. The RNA transcribed from DNA must then enter the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. Not only do the multiple processing steps from administered DNA to protein create lag times before the generation of the functional protein, each step represents an opportunity for error and damage to the cell. Further, it is known to be difficult to obtain DNA expression in cells as frequently DNA enters a cell but is not expressed or not expressed at reasonable rates or concentrations. This can be a particular problem when DNA is introduced into primary cells or modified cell lines.",

Relaxin facilitates angiogenesis and contributes to the repair of vascular endothelium. It exerts its effects on the musculoskeletal and other systems through binding its receptor in different tissues, a process mediated by different signaling pathways. There are seven known relaxin family peptides, including relaxin (RLN)1, RLN2, RLN3, and insulin-like peptide (INSL)3, INSL4, INSL5, INSL6. RLN1 and RLN2 are involved in collagen regulation and metabolism in fibroblasts, while RLN3 is specific to the brain. RLN1 and RLN2 are also involved in the hemodynamic changes that occur during pregnancy, including cardiac output, renal blood flow, and arterial compliance. Further, RLN2 mediates vasodilation through increased production of nitric oxide through a phosphorylation cascade. Relaxin is also a cardiac stimulant, and it can cause vasodilation through the inhibition of angiotensin II and endothelin, two potent vasoconstrictors. The hormone has also been shown to increase calcium sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments and increase phosphorylation of the myofilaments by protein kinase C. The force generated by the myofilaments increases while the energy consumption of the cardiac myocytes does not.

Blood is a fluid comprising, e.g., plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets that is circulated by the heart through the vertebrate vascular system. The circulatory system becomes a reservoir for many toxins and pathogenic molecules upon their introduction to or production by the body. The circulatory system also serves as a reservoir for cellular secretions or detritus from within the body. The perpetual or aberrant circulation and proliferation of such molecules and entities can drive disease and/or exacerbate existing conditions.",

The short half-life often necessitates repeated injections and hospitalizations. It is thought that the short half-life may be due to both renal clearance, e.g., of proteins smaller than 60 kDa, and non-renal clearance, e.g., via liver excretion or immune-mediated removal. The activity of therapies is also often limited by an immune reaction elicited against them (see, e.g., Wang et al., Leukemia 2003, 17:1583). Several approaches are practiced in the art.",
            "One approach includes the use of \u201cerythrocyte ghosts\u201d that are derived from a hemolyzed red blood cell. To prepare erythrocyte ghosts, red blood cells undergo hypotonic lysis. The red blood cells are exposed to low ionic strength buffer causing them to burst. The resulting lysed cell membranes are isolated by centrifugation. The pellet of lysed red blood cell membranes is resuspended and incubated in the presence of the therapeutic agent, for example, such as an antibiotic or chemotherapeutic agent in a low ionic strength buffer. The therapeutic agent distributes within the cells. Erythrocyte ghosts and derivatives used to encapsulate payloads, such as therapeutic agents, can shield those payloads from the immune system, but the erythrocyte ghosts themselves are subject to rapid clearance by the reticulo-endothelial system (see, e.g., Loegering et al. 1987 Infect Immun 55(9):2074). Erythrocyte ghosts also elicit an immune response in mammalian subjects. These vesicles are typically constituted of both lipids and proteins, including potentially high amounts of phosphatidylserine, which is normally found on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This leads to potential immunological reactions in the recipient mammalian subjects. The undesirable effects seriously limit the potential for therapeutic applications of technologies based on erythrocyte ghosts.",
            "Another approach for drug encapsulation includes the use of exosomes. \u201cExosomes\u201d include cell-derived vesicles that are present in many and perhaps all biological fluids, including blood, urine, and cultured medium of cell cultures. The reported diameter of exosomes is between 30 and 100 nm, which is larger than low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but smaller than, for example, red blood cells. Exosomes are either released from the cell when multivesicular bodies fuse with the plasma membrane or they are released directly from the plasma membrane. Exosome delivery methods require a better understanding of their biology, as well as the development of production, characterization, targeting and cargo-loading nanotechnologies. Attempts have been made to manufacture exosomes using human embryonic stem cell derived mesenchymal stem cells (hESC-MSCs). However, as hESC-MSCs are not infinitely expansible, large scale production of exosomes would require replenishment of hESC-MSC through derivation from hESCs and incur recurring costs for testing and validation of each new batch (Chen et al. 2011 Journal of Translational Medicine 9:47). Clinical translation is also hindered by the lack of suitable and scalable nanotechnologies for the purification and loading of exosomes (Lakhal and Wood 2011 BioEssays 33(10):737). Current ultracentrifugation protocols are commercially unreproducible, as they produce a heterogeneous mix of exosomes, other cellular vesicles and macromolecular complexes. Therefore, purification methods based on the use of specific, desired markers, such as the expression of a targeting moiety on the surface of the exosome, are required. In addition, siRNA loading into exosomes is relatively inefficient and cost-ineffective, highlighting the need for the development of transfection reagents tailored for nanoparticle applications. Further, exosomes are rapidly cleared from circulation and substantially accumulate in the liver within 24 hours of administration (Ohno et al., 2013 Mol Therapy 21(1):185), limiting their application for long-term drug delivery to the circulatory of a subject.",
            "Polyethylene glycol-coated liposomes are presently used as carriers for in vivo drug delivery. A \u201cliposome\u201d includes an artificially-prepared spherical vesicle composed of a lamellar phase lipid bilayer. The liposome can be used as a vehicle for administration of nutrients and pharmaceutical agents. Liposomes can be prepared by disrupting biological membranes, e.g., by sonication. Liposomes are often composed of phosphatidylcholine-enriched phospholipids and may also contain mixed lipid chains with surfactant properties such as egg phosphatidylethanolamine A liposome design may employ surface ligands for attaching to a target, e.g., unhealthy tissue. Types of liposomes include the multilamellar vesicle (MLV), the small unilamellar liposome vesicle (SUV), the large unilamellar vesicle (LUV), and the cochleate vesicle. Liposomes as carriers of anthracycline antibiotics have been a subject of a great number of studies. As a result, liposome formulations of daunorubicin (DaunoXome\u2122) and doxorubicin (Doxil\u2122) are now commercially available. The pharmacokinetics of the liposomal forms of anthracycline antibiotics differ from that of their free forms in higher peak concentrations and longer circulations times of the drugs. The kinetics of DaunoXome and Doxil clearance from plasma is close to mono-exponential. The half-life of DaumoXome in patient plasma is on the order of a few hours. In Doxil, polyethylene glycol-coated liposomes are used. The immune system poorly recognizes such liposomes; therefore the plasma half-life of Doxil is in the order of tens of hours.",
            "Red blood cells have been considered for use, e.g., to degrade toxic metabolites or inactivate xenobiotics, as drug delivery systems, as carriers of antigens for vaccination, and in other biomedical applications (Magnani Ed. 2003, Erythrocyte Engineering for Drug Delivery and Targeting). Many of these applications require procedures for the transient opening of pores across the red cell membrane. Drugs have commonly been loaded into freshly isolated red blood cells, without culturing, using disruptive methods based on hypotonic shock. Hypotonic dialysis can induce a high degree of hemolysis, irreversible modifications in the morphology of the cells and phosphotidyl serine exposure, which has been recognized as an important parameter associated with premature red blood cells removal and induction of transfusion-related pathologies (Favretto 2013 J Contr Rel).",
            "Many drugs, particularly protein therapeutics, stimulate immunogenic responses that include B cell antibody production, T cell activation, and macrophage phagocytosis. The causes of immunogenicity can be extrinsic or intrinsic to the protein. Extrinsic factors are drug formulation, aggregate formation, degradation products, contaminants and dosing. The administration mode, as well as the drug regimen, also strongly influences how immunogenicity is assessed. That is, immunogenicity will have different effects for drugs that are given in acute indications compared to drugs to treat chronic diseases. In the latter case, patients are exposed to the drug over a longer period of time and as such can mount a complete response. Pegylation is a technology designed to prolong the half-life, as well as minimize immunogenic responses. In contrast to assumptions that polyethylene glycol (PEG) is non-immunogenic and non-antigenic, certain animal studies show that uricase, ovalbumin and some other PEGylated agents can elicit antibody formation against PEG (anti-PEG). In humans, anti-PEG may limit therapeutic efficacy and/or reduce tolerance of PEG-asparaginase (PEG-ASNase) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and of pegloticase in patients with chronic gout, but did not impair hyposensitization of allergic patients with mPEG-modified ragweed extract or honeybee venom or the response to PEG-IFN in patients with hepatitis C. Anti-PEG antibodies can be found in 22-25% of healthy blood donors. Two decades earlier, the occurrence was 0.2%. This increase may be due to an improvement of the limit of detection of antibodies and to greater exposure to PEG and PEG-containing compounds in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and processed food products. These results raise concerns regarding the efficacy of PEG-conjugated drugs for a subset of patients (Garay, Expert Opin Drug Deliv, 2012 9(11):1319).",
            "Attempts in the art to create passive half-life improvement methods focus on increasing the apparent hydrodynamic radius of a drug. The kidney's glomerular filtration apparatus is the primary site in the body where blood components are filtered, see for reference e.g., Osicka et al. Clin Sci 1997 93:65 and Myers et al. Kidney Int 1982 21:633. The main determinant of filtration is the hydrodynamic radius of the molecule in the blood; smaller molecules (<80 kDa) are filtered out of the blood to a higher extent than larger molecules. Researchers have used this generalized rule to modify drugs to exhibit a larger hydrodynamic radius and thus longer half-life, mainly via chemical conjugation to large molecular weight water-soluble polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). Numerous PEGylated protein and small molecule therapeutics are currently offered in the clinic (Pasut and Veronese, 2009 Adv Drug Deliv Rev 61(13):1177; Fishburn, 2008 J Pharm Sci 97(10):4167). Though effective in many cases in increasing circulation half-life, especially as the hydrodynamic radius of the graft or fusion increases (Gao, Liu, et al., 2009 PNAS 106(36):15231), these methods offer challenges in manufacturing and maintenance of biological effector function. Heterogeneities in conjugation reactions can cause complex product mixtures with varying biological activities, due mostly to the utilization of site-unspecific chemistries. Extensive biochemical characterization often follows precise purification methods to retain a homogenous therapeutic product (Huang, Gough, et al, 2009 Anal Chem 81(2):567; Bailon, Palleroni, et al., 2001 Bioconj Chem 12(2):195; Dhalluin, Ross, et al., 2005 Bioconj Chem 16(3):504). Furthermore, attachment of large moieties, such as branched PEGs, to reactive zones of proteins can lead to decreased receptor affinity (Fishburn, 2008 J Pharm Sci 97(10):4167).",
            "Albumin may be used to bind a therapeutic protein for increased circulation of the drug (Dennis et al, 2002 J Bil Chem 277(38):35035; Walker, Dunlevy, et al., 2010 Prot Engr Des Sel 23(4):271) to increase the apparent size of the therapeutic by engineering it to bind another protein in the blood. In this manner, the drug attains its large molecular size only after administration into the blood stream. The addition of affinity-matured serum albumin-binding peptides to antibody fragments increased their circulation time 24 fold in mice (Dennis et al, 2002 J Bil Chem 277(38):35035). This method is complicated by the dynamics of albumin recycle by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and the use of cysteine-constrained cyclic peptides for functionality. Alternatively, recombinant addition of large antibody fragments may be made to a protein drug. This may cause structural as well as manufacturing complications, e.g., because of the use of complex cyclic or large domains for functionality. Despite high affinity for albumin, they require the physical constraint of correctly forming a cyclic structure prior to use. Methods of fusing larger antibody fragments may not be amendable to proteins with an already complex folding structure or low expression yield.",
            "The potential of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, antibody-coupled T-cell receptor (ACTR) therapies and other adoptive T-cell therapies in effecting complete and durable responses has been demonstrated in a number of malignant and infectious diseases. The development of more potent T cells is limited, however, by safety concerns, highlighted by the occurrence of on-target and off-target toxicities that, although uncommon, have been fatal on occasions. Timely pharmacological intervention can be effective in the management of adverse events but adoptively transferred T cells can persist long term, along with any unwanted effects. T cells targeting differentiation antigens can be expected to also recognize nonmalignant cells that express the same antigens, resulting in adverse events. For example, melanoma patients treated with T cells targeting melanocyte differentiation antigens, such as MART-1 and gp100, often develop vitiligo and uveitis. These on-target toxicities have been observed across all forms of therapeutic approaches, including tumor-infiltrating cells, in vitro-expanded T-cell clones and TCR-transgenic cells. In general, on-target autoimmunity is associated with tumor regression and is more prominent in treatment approaches that are more efficacious. On-target but off-tumour toxicities can be immediately life-threatening. For example, patients with colorectal cancer with lung and liver metastases may develop respiratory distress within 15 min of HER2-specific CAR T-cell infusion and may subsequently die from multiorgan failure 5 days later. As T-cell therapy becomes more effective, acute toxicities have also become more evident. Cytokine release syndrome, which is characterized by fevers, rigors, hypotension and hypoxia, has been observed in a number of CD19 CAR T-cell studies as a result of large-scale T-cell activation upon the recognition of CD19+ malignant cells.",

            "The present invention generally relates to novel cationic lipids that can be used in combination with other lipid components, such as neutral lipids, cholesterol and polymer conjugated lipids, to form lipid nanoparticles with oligonucleotides, to facilitate the intracellular delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids (e.g. oligonucleotides, messenger RNA) both in vitro and in vivo.",
            "Description of the Related Art",
            "There are many challenges associated with the delivery of nucleic acids to effect a desired response in a biological system. Nucleic acid based therapeutics have enormous potential but there remains a need for more effective delivery of nucleic acids to appropriate sites within a cell or organism in order to realize this potential. Therapeutic nucleic acids include, e.g., messenger RNA (mRNA), antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, DNAzymes, plasmids, immune stimulating nucleic acids, antagomir, antimir, mimic, supermir, and aptamers. Some nucleic acids, such as mRNA or plasmids, can be used to effect expression of specific cellular products as would be useful in the treatment of, for example, diseases related to a deficiency of a protein or enzyme. The therapeutic applications of translatable nucleotide delivery are extremely broad as constructs can be synthesized to produce any chosen protein sequence, whether or not indigenous to the system. The expression products of the nucleic acid can augment existing levels of protein, replace missing or non-functional versions of a protein, or introduce new protein and associated functionality in a cell or organism.",
            "Some nucleic acids, such as miRNA inhibitors, can be used to effect expression of specific cellular products that are regulated by miRNA as would be useful in the treatment of, for example, diseases related to deficiency of protein or enzyme. The therapeutic applications of miRNA inhibition are extremely broad as constructs can be synthesized to inhibit one or more miRNA that would in turn regulate the expression of mRNA products. The inhibition of endogenous miRNA can augment its downstream target endogenous protein expression and restore proper function in a cell or organism as a means to treat disease associated to a specific miRNA or a group of miRNA.",
            "Other nucleic acids can down-regulate intracellular levels of specific mRNA and, as a result, down-regulate the synthesis of the corresponding proteins through processes such as RNA interference (RNAi) or complementary binding of antisense RNA. The therapeutic applications of antisense oligonucleotide and RNAi are also extremely broad, since oligonucleotide constructs can be synthesized with any nucleotide sequence directed against a target mRNA. Targets may include mRNAs from normal cells, mRNAs associated with disease-states, such as cancer, and mRNAs of infectious agents, such as viruses. To date, antisense oligonucleotide constructs have shown the ability to specifically down-regulate target proteins through degradation of the cognate mRNA in both in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, antisense oligonucleotide constructs are currently being evaluated in clinical studies.",
            "However, two problems currently face using oligonucleotides in therapeutic contexts. First, free RNAs are susceptible to nuclease digestion in plasma. Second, free RNAs have limited ability to gain access to the intracellular compartment where the relevant translation machinery resides. Lipid nanoparticles formed from cationic lipids with other lipid components, such as neutral lipids, cholesterol, PEG, PEGylated lipids, and oligonucleotides have been used to block degradation of the RNAs in plasma and facilitate the cellular uptake of the oligonucleotides.",
            "There remains a need for improved cationic lipids and lipid nanoparticles for the delivery of oligonucleotides. Preferably, these lipid nanoparticles would provide optimal drug:lipid ratios, protect the nucleic acid from degradation and clearance in serum, be suitable for systemic delivery, and provide intracellular delivery of the nucleic acid. In addition, these lipid-nucleic acid particles should be well-tolerated and provide an adequate therapeutic index, such that patient treatment at an effective dose of the nucleic acid is not associated with unacceptable toxicity and/or risk to the patient. The present invention provides these and related advantages."

            "There are multiple problems with prior methodologies of effecting protein expression. For example, heterologous DNA introduced into a cell can be inherited by daughter cells (whether or not the heterologous DNA has integrated into the chromosome) or by offspring. Introduced DNA can integrate into host cell genomic DNA at some frequency, resulting in alterations and/or damage to the host cell genomic DNA. In addition, multiple steps must occur before a protein is made. Once inside the cell, DNA must be transported into the nucleus where it is transcribed into RNA. The RNA transcribed from DNA must then enter the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. This need for multiple processing steps creates lag times before the generation of a protein of interest. Further, it is difficult to obtain DNA expression in cells; frequently DNA enters cells but is not expressed or not expressed at reasonable rates or concentrations. This can be a particular problem when DNA is introduced into cells such as primary cells or modified cell lines.",
            "Naturally occurring RNAs are synthesized from four basic ribonucleotides: ATP, CTP, UTP and GTP, but may contain post-transcriptionally modified nucleotides. Further, approximately one hundred different nucleoside alterations have been identified in RNA (Rozenski, J, Crain, P, and McCloskey, J. (1999). The RNA Modification Database: 1999 update. Nucl Acids Res 27: 196-197).",

        "paragraph": [
            "Circular RNA was first discovered in 1979 by electron microscope (Hsu et al., Nature (1979) 280:339-340; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). With its 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends joined together, circRNA has no free ends and has extraordinary long half-life (Harland & Misher, Development (1988) 102:837-852; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Recent studies have confirmed that circRNA is resistant to digestion with RNase R exonuclease and turns over more slowly than its counterpart linear RNA in vivo (Memczak et al. Nature (2013) 495:333-338; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). An analysis of circRNA and their associated linear mRNAs revealed that the circRNA isoforms were highly stable, with transcript half-lives exceeding 48 hours, while the associated linear transcripts exhibited half-lives of less than 20 hours (Jeck et al., RNA (2013) 19:141-157; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).",
            "Since their initial discovery circRNAs have been developed for various uses. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,903 to Sarnow et al., herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, circRNAs comprise an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element that engages a eukaryotic ribosome and an RNA sequence element encoding a polypeptide operatively linked to the IRES. The circRNA described by Sarnow can then be inserted into cells in order to produce a polypeptide of interest. U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,859 to Felgner et al., herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, describes polynucleotide sequences, which may be circularized, which may be administered directly to tissues in order to produce proteins. CircRNAs for vascular disease are described in International Publication No. WO2012050975, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, where Sharpless et al. described circRNAs comprising one or more ANRIL exons which play an active role in atherosclerotic vascular disease. U.S. Pat. No. 5,426,180 to Kool et al., herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, discloses single-stranded circular oligonucleotides that bind to both single-stranded and double-stranded target nucleic acids.",
            "The production of circRNAs has been attempted by various methods such as the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,210,931 to Feldstein et al., herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, which teaches a method of synthesizing circRNAs by inserting DNA fragments into a plasmid containing sequences having the capability of spontaneous cleavage and self-circularization. Another method is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,773,244 to Ares Jr. et al. which teaches producing circRNAs by making a DNA construct encoding an RNA cyclase ribozyme, expressing the DNA construct as an RNA, and then allowing the RNA to self-splice, which produces a circRNA free from intron in vitro. International Publication No. WO1992001813 to Ruth et al., herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, teaches a process of making single strand circular nucleic acids by synthesizing a linear polynucleotide, combining the linear nucleotide with a complementary linking oligonucleotide under hybridization conditions, and ligating the linear polynucleotide.",

            "Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) pathways play a central role in the wound healing process, including revascularization of damaged tissues, improving vascular permeability, and formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). It remains challenging to deliver agents to augment VEGF-A pathways for potential therapeutic effects such as improving wound healing in a subject.",
            "A diverse number of methods has been attempted to allow clinically tractable approaches to increase VEGF-A proteins in target tissues. However, each of the approaches has significant drawbacks. For instance, systemic VEGF-A protein delivery can result in significant hypotension and VEGF-A is rapidly degraded. Viral encapsulated and naked VEGF-A DNA plasmids have limited temporal control of protein expression and the efficiency of in vivo expression can be highly variable and non-dose dependent. As a result, these limitations have restricted the applicability of augmenting VEGF-A levels as a therapeutic agent.",
            "Another recent development is to deliver therapeutic RNAs encoding VEGF-A proteins. However, delivery of natural RNAs to cells can be challenging due to the relative instability and low cell permeability of such RNA molecules. Also, natural RNAs can trigger immune activation (See, e.g., Kaczmarek et al., \u201cAdvances in the delivery of RNA therapeutics: from concept to clinical reality,\u201d Genome Med., 2017, 9: 60), which limit their uses for delivering VEGF-A proteins to target tissues.",
            "Accordingly, there remains a need for compositions that allow for effective and safe delivery of RNAs encoding VEGF-A proteins. In addition, there remains a need for alternative methods to augment VEGF-A pathways for potential therapeutic effects such as improving wound healing in a subject."

For example, genome engineering can be used to alter (e.g., correct or knock-out) a gene carrying a harmful mutation, or to explore the function of a gene. Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disrupting normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unwanted effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells. Recent genome engineering strategies, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), homing endonucleases (HEs) and MegaTALs, enable a specific area of the DNA to be modified, thereby increasing the precision of the alteration compared to early technologies. These newer platforms offer a much larger degree of reproducibility, but still have their limitations.",

            "Cystic Fibrosis (\u201cCF\u201d) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by the abnormal buildup of sticky and thick mucus in patients. CF is also known as cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, fibrocystic disease of the pancreas, or muscoviscidosis. Mucus is an important bodily fluid that lubricates and protects the lungs, reproductive system, digestive system, and other organs. However, CF patients produce thick and sticky mucus, which reduces the size of the airways leading to chronic coughing, wheezing, inflammation, bacterial infections, fibrosis, and cysts in the lungs. Additionally, most CF patients have mucus blocking the ducts in the pancreas, which prevents the release of insulin and digestive enzymes leading to diarrhea, malnutrition, poor growth, and weight loss. Gershman A. J. et al., Cleve Clin J Med. 73: 1065-1074 (2006). CF has an estimated incidence of 1 in 2,500 to 3,500 in Caucasian births, but is much more rare in other populations. Ratjen F. et al., Lancet 361: 681-689 (2003). Current treatment for CF only controls the symptoms and does not cure the disease. Specifically, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, bronchodilators, decongestants, a diet high in protein and fat, and vitamin supplements are prescribed to control the symptoms. In advanced lung disease, lung transplants have also been performed to provide a patient with undamaged lungs. However, none of these treatments completely or reliably controls the disease. As such, there is a need for improved therapy to treat CF.",

CFTR is an enzyme (E.C. 3.6.3.49) that plays a critical role in transport pathways and functions as a chloride ion channel. Lack of functional CFTR prevents excretion of chloride ions and leads to increased sodium ion absorption. Welsh, M. J. et al., J. Clin. Invest. 80: 1523-1526 (1987). This causes water to move from the mucus to cells resulting in a more viscous mucus. CFTR localizes to the cytoplasm, endosomes, extracellular space, and plasma membrane of cells. The protein is 1480 amino acids long. A complete or partial loss of CFTR function leads to thick and sticky mucus causing difficulty breathing, digestive problems, and shortened life span.",

            "Various approaches have been proposed to overcome allogeneic rejection of transplanted or engrafted cells including HLA-matching, blocking pathways that trigger T-cell activation with antibodies, use of a cocktail of immune suppressive drugs, and autologous cell therapy. Another strategy to dampen graft rejection involves minimization of allogenic differences between transplanted or engrafted cells and the recipient. The cell surface-expressed human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), molecules encoded by genes located in the human major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6, are the major mediators of immune rejection. Mismatch of a single HLA gene between the donor and subject can cause a robust immune response (Fleischhauer K. et al. \u201cBone marrow-allograft rejection by T lymphocytes recognizing a single amino acid difference in HLA-B44,\u201d N Engl J Med., 1990, 323:1818-1822). HLA genes are divided into MHC class I (MHC-I) and MHC class II (MHC-II). MHC-I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) are expressed in almost all tissue cell types, presenting \u201cnon-self\u201d antigen-processed peptides to CD8+ T cells, thereby promoting their activation to cytolytic CD8+ T cells. Transplanted or engrafted cells expressing \u201cnon-self\u201d MHC-I molecules will cause a robust cellular immune response directed at these cells and ultimately resulting in their demise by activated cytolytic CD8+ T cells. MHC-I proteins are intimately associated with beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for forming functional MHC-I molecules on the cell surface.",
            "In contrast to the wide cellular expression of MHC-I genes, expression of MHC-II genes is restricted to antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. HLA antigen genes are the most polymorphic genes observed in the human genome (Rubinstein P., \u201cHLA matching for bone marrow transplantation\u2014how much is enough?\u201d N Engl J Med., 2001, 345:1842-1844). The generation of a \u201cuniversal donor\u201d cell that is compatible with any HLA genotype provides an alternative strategy that could resolve the immune rejection and associated economical costs of current methodologies for immune evasion.",
            "To generate such a line of universal donor cell(s), one previous approach has been to functionally disrupt the expression of MHC-I and MHC-II class genes. This could be achieved through genetic disruption, e.g., of both genetic alleles encoding the MHC-I light chain, B2M. The resulting B2M-null cell line and its derivatives would be expected to exhibit greatly reduced surface MHC-I and thus, reduced immunogenicity to allogeneic CD8+ T cells. The transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) targeting approach has been used to generate B2M-deficient hESC lines by deletion of a few nucleotides in exon 2 of the B2M gene (Lu, P. et al., \u201cGenerating hypoimmunogenic human embryonic stem cells by the disruption of beta 2-microglobulin,\u201d Stem Cell Rev. 2013, 9:806-813). Although the B2M-targeted hESC lines appeared to be surface HLA-I deficient, they were found to still contain mRNAs specific for B2M and MHC-I. The B2M and MHC-I mRNAs were expressed at levels equivalent to those of untargeted hESCs (both constitutive and IFN-g induced). Thus, concern exists that these TALEN B2M-targeted hESC lines might express residual cell surface MHC-I that would be sufficient to cause immune rejection, such as has been observed with B2M2/2 mouse cells that also express B2M mRNA (Gross, R. and Rappuoli, R. \u201cPertussis toxin promoter sequences involved in modulation,\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci, 1993, 90:3913-3917). Although the TALEN B2M targeted hESC lines were not examined for off-target cleavage events, the occurrence of nonspecific cleavage when using TALENs remains a significant issue that would impose a major safety concern on their clinical use (Grau, J. et al. \u201cTALEN offer: genome-wide TALEN off-target prediction,\u201d Bioinformatics, 2013, 29:2931-2932; Guilinger J. P. et al. \u201cBroad specificity profiling of TALENs results in engineered nucleases with improved DNA-cleavage specificity,\u201d Nat Methods 2014, 11:429-435). Further, another report generated IPS cells that escaped allogeneic recognition by knocking out a first B2M allele and knocking in a HLA-E gene at a second B2M allele, which resulted in surface expression of HLA-E dimers or trimers in the absence of surface expression of HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C (Gornalusse, G. G. et al., \u201cHLA-E-expressing pluripotent stem cells escape allogeneic responses and lysis by NK cells,\u201d Nature Biotechnology, 2017, 35, 765-773).",
            "A potential limitation of some of the above strategies is that MHC class I-negative cells are susceptible to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells as HLA molecules serve as major ligand inhibitors to natural killer (NK) cells. Host NK cells have been shown to eliminate transplanted or engrafted B2M\u2212/\u2212 donor cells, and a similar phenomenon occurs in vitro with MHC class-I-negative human leukemic lines (Bix, M. et al., \u201cRejection of class I MHC-deficient haemopoietic cells by irradiated MHC-matched mice,\u201d Nature, 1991, 349, 329-331; Zarcone, D. et al., \u201cHuman leukemia-derived cell lines and clones as models for mechanistic analysis of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity,\u201d Cancer Res. 1987, 47, 2674-2682). Thus, there exists a need to improve upon previous methods to generate universal donor cells that can evade the immune response as well as a need to generate cells that can survive post-engraftment. As described herein, cell survival post-engraftment or post-transplantation may be mediated by a host of other pathways independent of allogeneic rejection e.g., hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress. Also as described herein, genetic introduction of survival factors (genes and/or proteins) may help cells to survive post-engraftment. As described herein, a universal donor cell line may combine properties that address both allogeneic rejection and survival post-engraftment."

            "Genome engineering refers to the strategies and techniques for the targeted, specific modification of the genetic information (genome) of living organisms. Genome engineering is a very active field of research because of the wide range of possible applications, particularly in the areas of human health. For example, genome engineering can be used to alter (e.g., correct or knock-out) a gene carrying a harmful mutation or to explore the function of a gene. Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disrupting normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unwanted effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells. Recent genome engineering strategies, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), homing endonucleases (HEs) and MegaTALs, enable a specific area of the DNA to be modified, thereby increasing the precision of the alteration compared to early technologies. These newer platforms offer a much larger degree of reproducibility, but still have their limitations.",

        "paragraph": [
            "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a genus of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae, in the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae. There are currently eight species in this genus, which have been identified and classified for different mammals, including humans, monkeys, and rodents. The most studied genus is human cytomegalovirus, also known as human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), which is widely distributed in the human population. Diseases associated with HHV-5 include mononucleosis and pneumonias. All herpesviruses share a characteristic ability to remain latent within the body over long periods of time. Although they may be found throughout the body, CMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands in humans and other mammals. Other CMV viruses are found in several mammal species, but species isolated from animals differ from HCMV in terms of genomic structure, and have not been reported to cause human disease.",
            "HCMV is endemic in most parts of the world. It is a ubiquitous large enveloped virus that infects 50 to 100% of the adult population worldwide. Although generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent hosts, HCMV infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised persons, such as infants following congenital or neonatal infections, transplant recipients, or AIDS patients.",
            "Primary infection normally results in subclinical disease after which the virus becomes latent, retaining the capacity to reactivate at a later time. The virus is transmitted through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk. In particular, individuals with undeveloped or compromised immunity are highly sensitive to infection by HCMV. It is estimated that at least 60% of the US population has been exposed to CMV, with a prevalence of more than 90% in high-risk groups (e.g., unborn babies whose mothers become infected with CMV during the pregnancy or people with HIV).",
            "In healthy individuals, HCMV typically causes an asymptomatic infection or produces mild, flulike symptoms. However, among two populations, HCMV is responsible for serious medical conditions. First, HCMV is a major cause of congenital defects in newborns infected in utero. Among congenitally infected newborns, 5-10% have major clinical symptoms at birth, such as microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, and hepatitis, as well as cytomegalic inclusion disease, which affects many tissues and organs including the central nervous system, liver, and retina and can lead to multi-organ failure and death. Other infants may be asymptomatic at birth, but later develop hearing loss or central nervous system abnormalities causing, in particular, poor intellectual performance and mental retardation. These pathologies are due in part to the ability of HCMV to enter and replicate in diverse cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, neurons, and monocytes/macrophages.",
            "The second population at risk are immunocompromised patients, such as those suffering from HIV infection and those undergoing transplantations. In this situation, the virus becomes an opportunistic pathogen and causes severe disease with high morbidity and mortality. The clinical disease causes a variety of symptoms including fever, pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, myelitis, colitis, uveitis, retinitis, and neuropathy. Rarer manifestations of HCMV infections in immunocompetent individuals include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, meningoencephalitis, pericarditis, myocarditis, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. Moreover, HCMV infection increases the risk of organ graft loss through transplant vascular sclerosis and restenosis, and may increase atherosclerosis in transplant patients as well as in the general population. It is estimated that HCMV infection causes clinical disease in 75% of patients in the first year after transplantation.",
            "There is currently no approved HCMV vaccine. Two candidate vaccines, Towne and gB/MF59, have completed phase II efficacy trials. The Towne vaccine appears protective against both infection and disease caused by challenge with pathogenic Toledo strain and also appears to be effective in preventing severe post-transplantation CMV disease. However, in a small phase II clinical trial, a low dose of Towne vaccine failed to show protection against infection of seronegative mothers who had children actively shedding CMV.",
            "The gB/MF59 vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine comprised of a transmembrane-deleted version of HCMV gB protein, which induces high levels of fibroblast entry neutralizing antibodies in humans and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in both adults and toddlers. A recent phase II double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the gB/MF59 vaccine revealed a 50% efficacy in inducing sterilizing immunity. As this vaccine induces potent antibody responses but very weak T-cell responses, the partial efficacy provided by the vaccine is thought to be primarily antibody-mediated. While this HCMV vaccine is the first to show any protective efficacy, its 50% protection falls short of the 80-90% desired for most vaccines.",
            "In addition, antibody therapy has been used to control HCMV infection in immunocompromised individuals and to reduce the pathological consequences of maternal-fetal transmission, although such therapy is usually not sufficient to eradicate the virus. HCMV immunoglobulins (Igs) have been administered to transplant patients in association with immunosuppressive treatments for prophylaxis of HCMV disease with mixed results. Antibody therapy has also been used to control brief infection and prevent disease in newborns. However, these products are plasma derivatives with relatively low potency and have to be administered by intravenous infusion at very high doses in order to deliver sufficient amounts of neutralizing antibodies.",
            "HCMV is the leading viral cause of neurodevelopmental abnormality and other birth defects in children and the costs to society are substantial. Although antiviral therapy is available, the treatment with antiviral agents is imperfect and development of a CMV vaccine is the most promising strategy for preventing CMV infection. Given that the health and economic benefits of effective HCMV vaccines are significant, the US Institute of Medicine and US National Vaccine Program Office has categorized development of a CMV vaccine as a highest priority, but no candidate vaccine is under consideration for licensure."

            "There are multiple problems with prior methodologies of effecting protein expression. For example, introduced DNA can integrate into host cell genomic DNA at some frequency, resulting in alterations and/or damage to the host cell genomic DNA. Alternatively, the heterologous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) introduced into a cell can be inherited by daughter cells (whether or not the heterologous DNA has integrated into the chromosome) or by offspring. In addition, assuming proper delivery and no damage or integration into the host genome, there are multiple steps which must occur before the encoded protein is made. Once inside the cell, DNA must be transported into the nucleus where it is transcribed into RNA. The RNA transcribed from DNA must then enter the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. Not only do the multiple processing steps from administered DNA to protein create lag times before the generation of the functional protein, each step represents an opportunity for error and damage to the cell. Further, it is known to be difficult to obtain DNA expression in cells as DNA frequently enters a cell but is not expressed or not expressed at reasonable rates or concentrations. This can be a particular problem when DNA is introduced into primary cells or modified cell lines.",

In addition, these lipid-nucleic acid particles should be well-tolerated and provide an adequate therapeutic index, such that patient treatment at an effective dose of the nucleic acid is not associated with unacceptable toxicity and/or risk to the patient. The present invention provides these and related advantages."

Its incidence peaks around 4-12 months of age, and the virus is responsible for 3-10% of hospitalizations, mainly for bronchiolitis and pneumonia. PIV3 can be fatal, and in some instances is associated with neurologic diseases, such as febrile seizures. It can also result in airway remodeling, a significant cause of morbidity. In developing regions of the world, infants and young children are at the highest risk of mortality, either from primary PIV3 viral infection or a secondary consequences, such as bacterial infections.

            "There are multiple problems with prior methodologies of effecting protein expression. For example, heterologous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) introduced into a cell can be inherited by daughter cells (whether or not the heterologous DNA has integrated into the chromosome) or by offspring. Introduced DNA can integrate into host cell genomic DNA at some frequency, resulting in alterations and/or damage to the host cell genomic DNA. In addition, multiple steps must occur before a protein is made. Once inside the cell, DNA must be transported into the nucleus where it is transcribed into RNA. The RNA transcribed from DNA must then enter the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. This need for multiple processing steps creates lag times before the generation of a protein of interest. Further, it is difficult to obtain DNA expression in cells; frequently DNA enters cells but is not expressed or not expressed at reasonable rates or concentrations. This can be a particular problem when DNA is introduced into cells such as primary cells or modified cell lines. The role of nucleoside modifications on the immuno-stimulatory potential, stability, and on the translation efficiency of RNA, and the consequent benefits to this for enhancing protein expression and producing therapeutics have been previously explored.

For example, genome engineering can be used to alter (e.g., correct or knock-out) a gene carrying a harmful mutation or to explore the function of a gene. Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disrupting normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unwanted effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells. Recent genome engineering strategies, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), homing endonucleases (HEs) and MegaTALs, enable a specific area of the DNA to be modified, thereby increasing the precision of the alteration compared to early technologies. These newer platforms offer a much larger degree of reproducibility, but still have their limitations.",
            "Despite efforts from researchers and medical professionals worldwide who have been trying to address genetic disorders, and despite the promise of genome engineering approaches, there still remains a critical need for developing safe and effective treatments involving FXN related indications.",
            "By using genome engineering tools to create permanent changes to the genome that can address the FXN related disorders or conditions with as few as a single treatment, the resulting therapy may completely remedy certain FXN related indications and/or diseases."

Infection was associated with a mild, self-limiting febrile illness characterized by headache, rash, conjunctivitis, myalgia, and arthralgia. Since 2010, and especially in the context of its spread and dissemination to countries of the Western Hemisphere, more severe clinical consequences have been observed. Infection of fetuses in utero during pregnancy, particularly during the first and second trimesters, has been associated with placental insufficiency and congenital malformations including cerebral calcifications, microcephaly, and miscarriage. In adults, ZIKV infection is linked to an increased incidence of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disease characterized by paralysis and polyneuropathy. In addition to mosquito and in utero transmission, sexual transmission of ZIKV has been described from men-to-women, men-to-men, and women-to-men. Persistent ZIKV infection can occur, as viral RNA has been detected in semen, sperm, and vaginal secretions up to 6 months following infection. Thus, ZIKV is now a global disease with locally-acquired and travel-associated transmission through multiple routes in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has prompted a global effort to develop safe and effective vaccines."

In regions densely populated with both people and livestock, zoonotic diseases can spread very quickly. With changes in the environment, human behavior and habitat, increasingly these infections are emerging from wildlife species. Specific examples of zoonotic viruses include Lassa virus, Nipah virus, and betacoronaviruses.",
            "Lassa Virus. Lassa virus (LASV), a segmented negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the family Arenaviridae, is endemic to West Africa. Transmission typically occurs through contact with infected rodents or virus-contaminated rodent excreta, and person-to-person transmission. The LASV expresses just one protein on its surface, termed GPC, which mediates both attachment to and entry of host cells. GPC is a class I viral fusion protein that forms trimers on the viral surface. Each monomer in the trimer is assembled by distinct GP1 and GP2 subunits that mediate receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively. Notably, on the viral surface, GP2 is coiled about the base of GP1 in a structure that is only metastable. The complex is prone to rapid disassembly of GP1 from GP2 and rearrangement of the GP2 into a much more stable six-helix bundle. The release of energy achieved by collapsing of the metastable viral-surface conformation to the much more stable six-helix bundle conformation drives fusion of viral and host membranes during infection. Because of its metastability, it is difficult to maintain GPC on its trimeric pre-fusion configuration when expressed recombinantly or even when expressed on some particle surfaces. Antibodies against the resulting separated subunits are not potently neutralizing. As a result, prior vaccine approaches that included natural GPC failed to elicit an effective antibody response, leading vaccine manufacturers to instead focus on induction of cell-mediated immunity as the most likely correlate of protection. Further, in the absence of knowledge about how to create or purify stabilized Lassa virus GPC trimeric, vaccine makers did not have the necessary reagents to evaluate the most ideal antibody responses.",
            "The structure of the viral surface GP trimer remained unknown for Lassa and all other arenaviruses until this year. After a ten-year effort in engineering LASV GPC, using the GOC to evaluate human antibody responses from survivors, several high-resolution three-dimensional structures of the Lassa virus GPC in complex with these antibodies have been identified.",

New outbreaks have occurred every year since, with fatality rates ranging from 40-70%. Nipah virus is classified as a BSL-4 agent and as a Category C priority pathogen by the CDC and NIAID. The primary reservoir is Pteropus bats; however, the virus is able to infect and replicate in many mammals (Luby et al 2013; Angeletti et al 2016).",

MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 within the Arabian Peninsula and since its initial outbreak, Sporadic MERS-CoV infections continue to appear within the Arabian Peninsula. The epidemiology of MERS-CoV infection in humans remains unclear and convoluted with Bats and Dromedary Camels being the major reservoirs for the virus. As of June 2016, the World Health Organization has reported a total of 1,769 MERS-CoV infections with a mortality rate of 36% and an ongoing risk of human to human transmission. The absence of a vaccine for MERS-CoV poses a severe global health threat due to its pandemic potential."

            "Various approaches have been proposed to overcome allogeneic rejection of transplanted or engrafted cells including HLA-matching, blocking pathways that trigger T-cell activation with antibodies, use of a cocktail of immune suppressive drugs, and autologous cell therapy. Another strategy to dampen graft rejection involves minimization of allogenic differences between transplanted or engrafted cells and the recipient. The cell surface-expressed human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), molecules encoded by genes located in the human major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6, are the major mediators of immune rejection. Mismatch of a single HLA gene between the donor and subject can cause a robust immune response (Fleischhauer K. et al. \u201cBone marrow-allograft rejection by T lymphocytes recognizing a single amino acid difference in HLA-B44,\u201d N Engl J Med., 1990, 323:1818-1822). HLA genes are divided into MHC class I (MHC-I) and MHC class II (MHC-II). MHC-I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) are expressed in almost all tissue cell types, presenting \u201cnon-self\u201d antigen-processed peptides to CD8+ T cells, thereby promoting their activation to cytolytic CD8+ T cells. Transplanted or engrafted cells expressing \u201cnon-self\u201d MHC-I molecules will cause a robust cellular immune response directed at these cells and ultimately resulting in their demise by activated cytolytic CD8+ T cells. MHC-I proteins are intimately associated with beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for forming functional MHC-I molecules on the cell surface.",
            "In contrast to the wide cellular expression of MHC-I genes, expression of MHC-II genes is restricted to antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. HLA antigen genes are the most polymorphic genes observed in the human genome (Rubinstein P., \u201cHLA matching for bone marrow transplantation\u2014how much is enough?\u201d N Engl J Med., 2001, 345:1842-1844). The generation of a \u201cuniversal donor\u201d cell that is compatible with any HLA genotype provides an alternative strategy that could resolve the immune rejection and associated economical costs of current methodologies for immune evasion.",
            "To generate such a line of universal donor cell(s), one previous approach has been to functionally disrupt the expression of MHC-I and MHC-II class genes. This could be achieved through genetic disruption, e.g., of both genetic alleles encoding the MHC-I light chain, B2M. The resulting B2M-null cell line and its derivatives would be expected to exhibit greatly reduced surface MHC-I and thus, reduced immunogenicity to allogeneic CD8+ T cells. The transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) targeting approach has been used to generate B2M-deficient hESC lines by deletion of a few nucleotides in exon 2 of the B2M gene (Lu, P. et al., \u201cGenerating hypoimmunogenic human embryonic stem cells by the disruption of beta 2-microglobulin,\u201d Stem Cell Rev. 2013, 9:806-813). Although the B2M-targeted hESC lines appeared to be surface HLA-I deficient, they were found to still contain mRNAs specific for B2M and MHC-I. The B2M and MHC-I mRNAs were expressed at levels equivalent to those of untargeted hESCs (both constitutive and IFN-g induced). Thus, concern exists that these TALEN B2M-targeted hESC lines might express residual cell surface MHC-I that would be sufficient to cause immune rejection, such as has been observed with B2M2/2 mouse cells that also express B2M mRNA (Gross, R. and Rappuoli, R. \u201cPertussis toxin promoter sequences involved in modulation,\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci, 1993, 90:3913-3917). Although the TALEN B2M targeted hESC lines were not examined for off-target cleavage events, the occurrence of nonspecific cleavage when using TALENs remains a significant issue that would impose a major safety concern on their clinical use (Grau, J. et al. \u201cTALENoffer: genome-wide TALEN off-target prediction,\u201d Bioinformatics, 2013, 29:2931-2932; Guilinger J. P. et al. \u201cBroad specificity profiling of TALENs results in engineered nucleases with improved DNA-cleavage specificity,\u201d Nat Methods 2014, 11:429-435). Further, another report generated IPS cells that escaped allogeneic recognition by knocking out a first B2M allele and knocking in a HLA-E gene at a second B2M allele, which resulted in surface expression of HLA-E dimers or trimers in the absence of surface expression of HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C (Gornalusse, G. G. et al., \u201cHLA-E-expressing pluripotent stem cells escape allogeneic responses and lysis by NK cells,\u201d Nature Biotechnology, 2017, 35, 765-773).",
            "A potential limitation of some of the above strategies are that MHC class I-negative cells are susceptible to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells as HLA molecules serve as major ligand inhibitors to natural killer (NK) cells. Host NK cells have been shown to eliminate transplanted or engrafted B2M\u2212/\u2212 donor cells, and a similar phenomenon occurs in vitro with MHC class-I-negative human leukemic lines (Bix, M. et al., \u201cRejection of class I MHC-deficient haemopoietic cells by irradiated MHC-matched mice,\u201d Nature, 1991, 349, 329-331; Zarcone, D. et al., \u201cHuman leukemia-derived cell lines and clones as models for mechanistic analysis of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity,\u201d Cancer Res. 1987, 47, 2674-2682). Thus, there exists a need to improve upon previous methods to generate universal donor cells that can evade the immune response as well as a need to generate cells that can survive post-engraftment. As described herein, cell survival post-engraftment may be mediated by a host of other pathways independent of allogeneic rejection e.g., hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress. Also as described herein, genetic introduction of survival factors (genes and/or proteins) may help cells to survive post-engraftment. As described herein, a universal donor cell line may combine properties that address both allogeneic rejection and survival post-engraftment."

The theory explains why most of the known molecular mechanisms can contribute to cancer yet there is no single dominant mechanism for the majority of clinical cases. However, the common mechanisms suggest that cancer vaccines may provide a universal solution in the treatment of cancer.",

Such methods, however, are not compatible for use in the preparation of mRNAs for therapeutic use, in particular, for human therapeutic use. RNAse III is known to digest ssRNA as well as dsRNA and in trying to remove dsRNA contaminants, the integrity of the desired ssRNA product is necessarily jeopardized.

With the host of undesired consequences brought about by standard treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy used today, genetic therapy for the manipulation of disease-related peptides and their functions provides a more targeted approach to disease diagnosis, treatment and management.

One approach to achieve these goals is to use tumor-directed immunotherapy, i.e., to focus the immune activation to the most relevant part of the immune system. This may improve anti-tumor efficacy as well as reduce immune-related adverse events. Tumor-directed immune activation can be achieved by local injections of immune modulators directly into the tumor or into the tumor area. Therapies focused on targeting checkpoint inhibitors and co-stimulatory receptors can generate tumor-specific T cell responses through localized immune activation.",

Data available from these trials indicate substantial activity accompanied by a favorable safety and toxicity profile in these patient populations.",
            "For example, checkpoint inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of melanoma. In particular, phase III clinical trials have revealed that therapies such as ipilimumab and pembrolizumab, which target the CTLA-4 and PD-1 immune checkpoints, respectively, have raised the three-year survival of patients with melanoma to \u02dc70%, and overall survival (>5 years) to \u02dc30%.",

In preclinical studies, it had been shown that that 45-80% of HNSCC tumors express programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) (Zandberg et al. (2014) Oral Oncol. 50:627-632). Currently there are dozens of clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy or in combination regimens in HNSCC. For example, clinical trials with PD1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 inhibitors are being tested in HNSCC. Data that the PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab might be effective in metastatic/recurrent (R/M) HNSCC patients were generated in the phase 1b Keynote-012 phase I/II trial (Cheng.

            "Unfortunately, errors in protein synthesis such as misincorporation of amino acids into the nascent polypeptide chain thereby generating sequence variations in the target protein can arise at any stage of gene expression. It has been estimated that error rates in typical cells are about 1 in 10 for DNA replication by  , about 1 in 10 bases for transcription in  and about 1 in 10 for codon translation in proteins produced in  or other mammalian expression systems (Reynolds et al.,  2010, 8:849-856; Kunkel, T A,  2004, 279:16895-16898; Rosenberge et al.,  1981, 183:561-563; Blank et al.,  1986, 25:5920-5928; Kramer et al.,  2007, 13: 87-96). In addition, error rates can be increased under stress conditions, such as during amino acid starvation (Parker et al.,  1978, 75:1091-1095) and in protein expression systems (Scorer et al.,  1991, 19:3511-3516). For example, in heterologous expression systems for overexpressing recombinant proteins, host cells undergo nutritional stress which in turn leads to increased amino acid misincorporation during translation. The undesired amino acid substitution can result in proteins with altered catalytic constants, specificity, and stability (Langridge, J,  1974, 27:309-319; Nene et al.,  1984, 194:166-172; Knowles J R,  1987, 236:1252-1258; and Cupples et al.,  1988, 120:637-644). Amino acid error in therapeutic proteins can potentially induce deleterious immune responses and abnormal protein-protein interactions. Methods for removing misincorporated proteins have proven to be difficult during downstream purification schemes, especially since the error-free proteins are typically several orders of magnitude higher in concentration than the proteins containing misincorporations (Huang et al.,  2012, 21(5):625-632).",
            "Misincorporation of serine residues for other amino acid residues, e.g., asparagine residues has been detected in antibodies (Shulman et al.,  1986, 83:7678-7682). Recombinant antibodies containing erroneous asparagine residues may exhibit altered structural and functional features, including altered sensitivity to proteolysis, reduced biological activity or increased immunogenicity (Yu et al.,  81(22):9282-9290. Thus, there is a need for methods and compositions for producing proteins (e.g., antibodies) that are free of amino acid misincorporations. Such methods should generate high protein yields and maintain high translational fidelity. The present invention satisfies this need as well as others."

The precursor form of the IL-12 p40 subunit (NM_002187; P29460; also referred to as IL-12B, natural killer cell stimulatory factor 2, cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor 2) is 328 amino acids in length, while its mature form is 306 amino acids long. The precursor form of the IL-12 p35 subunit (NM_000882; P29459; also referred to as IL-12A, natural killer cell stimulatory factor 1, cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor 1) is 219 amino acids in length and the mature form is 197 amino acids long. Id. The genes for the IL-12 p35 and p40 subunits reside on different chromosomes and are regulated independently of each other. Gately, M K et al.,  16: 495-521 (1998). Many different immune cells (e.g., dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and B cells) produce IL-12 upon antigenic stimuli. The active IL-12 heterodimer is formed following protein synthesis. Id.",
            "Due to its ability to activate both NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, IL-12 protein has been studied as a promising anti-cancer therapeutic since 1994. See Nastala, C. L. et al.,  153: 1697-1706 (1994). But despite high expectations, early clinical studies did not yield satisfactory results. Lasek W. et al.,  63: 419-435, 424 (2014). Repeated administration of IL-12, in most patients, led to adaptive response and a progressive decline of IL-12-induced interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) levels in blood. Id. Moreover, while it was recognized that IL-12-induced anti-cancer activity is largely mediated by the secondary secretion of IFN\u03b3, the concomitant induction of IFN\u03b3 along with other cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1) or chemokines (IP-10 or MIG) by IL-12 caused severe toxicity. Id.",
            "In addition to the negative feedback and toxicity, the marginal efficacy of the IL-12 therapy in clinical settings may be caused by the strong immunosuppressive environment in humans. Id. To minimize IFN\u03b3 toxicity and improve IL-12 efficacy, scientists tried different approaches, such as different dose and time protocols for IL-12 therapy. See Sacco, S. et al.,  90: 4473-4479 (1997); Leonard, J. P. et al.,  90: 2541-2548 (1997); Coughlin, C. M. et al.,  57: 2460-2467 (1997); Asselin-Paturel, C. et al.,  91: 113-122 (2001); and Saudemont, A. et al.,  16: 1637-1644 (2002). Nonetheless, these approaches have not significantly impacted patient survival. Kang, W. K., et al.,  12: 671-684 (2001).",
            "Membrane-anchored versions of IL-12 have been studied as a means of reducing toxicity associated with systemic administration, using retroviral and adenoviral vectors for expression in tumor cells. See Pan, W-Y. et al.,  20(5): 927-937 (2012). But, the use of viral vectors presents a potential health risk, since the underlying viruses can act as oncogenes and the viral vectors can be immunogenic.",
            "Currently, a number of IL-12 clinical trials are on-going. Though these multiple clinical trials have been on-going for nearly 20 years since the first human clinical trial of IL-12 in 1996, an FDA-approved IL-12 product is still not available. Thus, there is a need in the art for an improved therapeutic approach for using IL-12 to treat tumors."

            "There are many challenges associated with the delivery of nucleic acids to effect a desired response in a biological system. Nucleic acid based therapeutics have enormous potential but there remains a need for more effective delivery of nucleic acids to appropriate sites within a cell or organism in order to realize this potential. Therapeutic nucleic acids include, e.g., messenger RNA (mRNA), antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, DNAzymes, plasmids, immune stimulating nucleic acids, antagomir, antimir, mimic, supermir, and aptamers. Some nucleic acids, such as mRNA or plasmids, can be used to effect expression of specific cellular products as would be useful in the treatment of, for example, diseases related to a deficiency of a protein or enzyme. The therapeutic applications of translatable nucleotide delivery are extremely broad as constructs can be synthesized to produce any chosen protein sequence, whether or not indigenous to the system. The expression products of the nucleic acid can augment existing levels of protein, replace missing or non-functional versions of a protein, or introduce new protein and associated functionality in a cell or organism.",

The inhibition of endogenous miRNA can augment its downstream target endogenous protein expression and restore proper function in a cell or organism as a means to treat disease associated to a specific miRNA or a group of miRNA.",
            "Other nucleic acids can down-regulate intracellular levels of specific mRNA and, as a result, down-regulate the synthesis of the corresponding proteins through processes such as RNA interference (RNAi) or complementary binding of antisense RNA. The therapeutic applications of antisense oligonucleotide and RNAi are also extremely broad, since oligonucleotide constructs can be synthesized with any nucleotide sequence directed against a target mRNA. Targets may include mRNAs from normal cells, mRNAs associated with disease-states, such as cancer, and mRNAs of infectious agents, such as viruses. To date, antisense oligonucleotide constructs have shown the ability to specifically down-regulate target proteins through degradation of the cognate mRNA in both in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, antisense oligonucleotide constructs are currently being evaluated in clinical studies.",
            "However, two problems currently face using oligonucleotides in therapeutic contexts. First, free RNAs are susceptible to nuclease digestion in plasma. Second, free RNAs have limited ability to gain access to the intracellular compartment where the relevant translation machinery resides. Lipid nanoparticles formed from cationic lipids with other lipid components, such as neutral lipids, cholesterol, PEG, PEGylated lipids, and oligonucleotides have been used to block degradation of the RNAs in plasma and facilitate the cellular uptake of the oligonucleotides.",

In addition, these lipid-nucleic acid particles should be well-tolerated and provide an adequate therapeutic index, such that patient treatment at an effective dose of the nucleic acid is not associated with unacceptable toxicity and/or risk to the patient.

The modified proteins of the invention can be used to increase the yield of proteins having non-natural amino acids incorporated at an amber codon.",
        "paragraph": [
            "The use of bacterial cell-free extracts for in vitro protein synthesis offers several advantages over conventional in vivo protein expression methods. Cell-free systems can direct most, if not all, of the metabolic resources of the cell towards the exclusive production of one protein. Moreover, the lack of a cell wall and membrane components in vitro is advantageous since it allows for control of the synthesis environment. However, the efficiency of cell-free extracts can be decreased by bacterial proteins that inhibit protein synthesis, either directly or indirectly. Thus, inactivation of undesirable proteins that decrease the efficiency of protein synthesis should increase the yield of desirable proteins in cell-free extracts. For example, the inactivation of proteins that decrease the efficiency of protein synthesis should increase the yield of polypeptides having non-native amino acids incorporated at a defined amino acid residue. The introduction of non-native amino acids (nnAA) into polypeptides is useful for increasing the biological diversity and function of proteins. One approach for producing polypeptides having a nnAA incorporated at a defined amino acid residue is to use an nnAA, aminoacylated orthogonal CUA containing tRNA for introduction of the nnAA into the nascent polypeptide at an amber (stop) codon during protein translation. However, the incorporation of nnAA at an amber codon can be inhibited by the native bacterial termination complex, which normally recognizes the stop codon and terminates translation. Release Factor 1 (RF1) is a termination complex protein that facilitates the termination of translation by recognizing the amber codon in an mRNA sequence. RF1 recognition of the amber stop codon can promote pre-mature truncation products at the site of non-native amino acid incorporation, and thus decreased protein yield. Therefore, attenuating the activity of RF1 may increase nnAA incorporation into recombinant proteins.",
            "It has previously been shown that nnAA incorporation can be increased by attenuating RF1 activity in 3 ways: 1) neutralizing antibody inactivation of RF1, 2) genomic knockout of RF1 (in an RF2 bolstered strain), and 3) site specific removal of RF1 using a strain engineered to express RF1 containing a protein tag for removal by affinity chromatography (Chitin Binding Domain and His Tag). The present disclosure describes a novel method for inactivating RF1 by introducing proteolytic cleavage sites into the RF1 amino acid sequence. The cleavage sites are not accessible to the protease during bacterial cell growth, but are cleaved by the protease when the bacterial cells are lysed to produce cell-free extract. Thus, the yield of full length polypeptides having a nnAA incorporated at an amber codon is increased in bacterial cell extracts expressing modified RF1 variants described herein."

The resulting cell expresses the chimeric antigen receptor on its cell surface (e.g., CAR T-cell), and upon administration to the subject, the chimeric antigen receptor binds to the marker expressed by the neoplastic cell. This interaction with the neoplasia marker activates the CAR-T cell, which then cell kills the neoplastic cell.

Many different immune cells (e.g., dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and B cells) produce IL-12 upon antigenic stimuli. The active IL-12 heterodimer is formed following protein synthesis. Id.",
            "Due to its ability to activate both NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, IL-12 protein has been studied as a promising anti-cancer therapeutic since 1994. See Nastala, C. L. et al.,  153: 1697-1706 (1994). But despite high expectations, early clinical studies did not yield satisfactory results. Lasek W. et al.,  63: 419-435, 424 (2014). Repeated administration of IL-12, in most patients, led to adaptive response and a progressive decline of IL-12-induced interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) levels in blood. Id. Moreover, while it was recognized that IL-12-induced anti-cancer activity is largely mediated by the secondary secretion of IFN\u03b3, the concomitant induction of IFN\u03b3 along with other cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1) or chemokines (IP-10 or MIG) by IL-12 caused severe toxicity. Id.",
            "In addition to the negative feedback and toxicity, the marginal efficacy of the IL-12 therapy in clinical settings may be caused by the strong immunosuppressive environment in humans. Id. To minimize IFN\u03b3 toxicity and improve IL-12 efficacy, scientists tried different approaches, such as different dose and time protocols for IL-12 therapy. See Sacco, S. et al.,  90: 4473-4479 (1997); Leonard, J. P. et al.,  90: 2541-2548 (1997); Coughlin, C.

Nonetheless, these approaches have not significantly impacted patient survival. Kang, W. K., et al.,  12: 671-684 (2001).",
            "Membrane-anchored versions of IL-12 have been studied as a means of reducing toxicity associated with systemic administration, using retroviral and adenoviral vectors for expression in tumor cells. See Pan, W-Y. et al.,  20(5): 927-937 (2012). But, the use of viral vectors presents a potential health risk, since the underlying viruses can act as oncogenes and the viral vectors can be immunogenic.",
            "Currently, a number of IL-12 clinical trials are on-going. Though these multiple clinical trials have been on-going for nearly 20 years since the first human clinical trial of IL-12 in 1996, an FDA-approved IL-12 product is still not available. Thus, there is a need in the art for an improved therapeutic approach for using IL-12 to treat tumors."

Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion location of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disruption of normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unintended effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells. Common genome engineering strategies, such as ZFNs, TALENs, HEs, and MegaTALs, allow a specific area of the DNA to be modified, thereby increasing precision of the correction or insertion compared to earlier technologies.

Another strategy to dampen graft rejection involves minimization of allogenic differences between transplanted or engrafted cells and the recipient. The cell surface-expressed human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), molecules encoded by genes located in the human major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6, are the major mediators of immune rejection. Mismatch of a single HLA gene between the donor and subject can cause a robust immune response (Fleischhauer K. et al. \u201cBone marrow-allograft rejection by T lymphocytes recognizing a single amino acid difference in HLA-B44,\u201d N Engl J Med., 1990, 323:1818-1822). HLA genes are divided into MHC class I (MHC-I) and MHC class II (MHC-II). MHC-I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) are expressed in almost all tissue cell types, presenting \u201cnon-self\u201d antigen-processed peptides to CD8+ T cells, thereby promoting their activation to cytolytic CD8+T 70198359.4 cells. Transplanted or engrafted cells expressing \u201cnon-self\u201d MHC-I molecules will cause a robust cellular immune response directed at these cells and ultimately resulting in their demise by activated cytolytic CD8+ T cells. MHC-I proteins are intimately associated with beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for forming functional MHC-I molecules on the cell surface.",
            "In contrast to the wide cellular expression of MHC-I genes, expression of MHC-II genes is restricted to antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. HLA antigen genes are the most polymorphic genes observed in the human genome (Rubinstein P., \u201cHLA matching for bone marrow transplantation\u2014how much is enough?\u201d N Engl J Med., 2001, 345:1842-1844). The generation of a \u201cuniversal donor\u201d cell that is compatible with any HLA genotype provides an alternative strategy that could resolve the immune rejection and associated economical costs of current methodologies for immune evasion.",
            "To generate such a line of universal donor cell(s), one previous approach has been to functionally disrupt the expression of MHC-I and MHC-II class genes. This could be achieved through genetic disruption, e.g., of both genetic alleles encoding the MHC-I light chain, B2M. The resulting B2M KO cell line and its derivatives would be expected to exhibit greatly reduced surface MHC-I and thus, reduced immunogenicity to allogeneic CD8+ T cells. The transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) targeting approach has been used to generate B2M-deficient hESC lines by deletion of a few nucleotides in exon 2 of the B2M gene (Lu, P. et al., \u201cGenerating hypoimmunogenic human embryonic stem cells by the disruption of beta 2-microglobulin,\u201d Stem Cell Rev. 2013, 9:806-813). Although the B2M-targeted hESC lines appeared to be surface HLA-I deficient, they were found to still contain mRNAs specific for B2M and MHC-I. The B2M and MHC-I mRNAs were expressed at levels equivalent to those of untargeted hESCs (both constitutive and IFN-g induced). Thus, concern exists that these TALEN B2M-targeted hESC lines might express residual cell surface MHC-I that would be sufficient to cause immune rejection, such as has been observed with B2M2/2 mouse cells that also express B2M mRNA (Gross, R. and Rappuoli, R. \u201cPertussis toxin promoter sequences involved in modulation,\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci, 1993, 90:3913-3917). Although the TALEN B2M targeted hESC lines were not examined for off-target cleavage events, the occurrence of nonspecific cleavage when using TALENs remains a significant issue that would impose a major safety concern on their clinical use (Grau, J. et al. \u201cTALENoffer: genome-wide TALEN off-target prediction,\u201d Bioinformatics, 2013, 29:2931-2932; Guilinger J. P. et al. \u201cBroad specificity profiling of TALENs results in engineered nucleases with improved DNA-cleavage specificity,\u201d Nat Methods 2014, 11:429-435). Further, another report generated IPS cells that escaped allogeneic recognition by knocking out a first B2M allele and knocking in a HLA-E gene at a second B2M allele, which resulted in surface expression of HLA-E dimers or trimers in the absence of surface expression of HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C (Gornalusse, G. G. et al., \u201cHLA-E-expressing pluripotent stem cells escape allogeneic responses and lysis by NK cells,\u201d Nature Biotechnology, 2017, 35, 765-773).",
            "A potential limitation of some of the above strategies are that MHC class I-negative cells are susceptible to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells as HLA molecules serve as major ligand inhibitors to natural killer (NK) cells. Host NK cells have been shown to eliminate transplanted or engrafted B2M\u2212/\u2212 donor cells, and a similar phenomenon occurs in vitro with MEW class-I-negative human leukemic lines (Bix, M. et al., \u201cRejection of class I MHC-deficient haemopoietic cells by irradiated MHC-matched mice,\u201d Nature, 1991, 349, 329-331; Zarcone, D. et al., \u201cHuman leukemia-derived cell lines and clones as models for mechanistic analysis of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity,\u201d Cancer Res. 1987, 47, 2674-2682). Thus, there exists a need to improve upon previous methods to generate universal donor cells that can evade the immune response as well as a need to generate cells that can survive post-engraftment. As described herein, cell survival post-engraftment may be mediated by a host of other pathways independent of allogeneic rejection e.g., hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress. Also as described herein, genetic introduction of survival factors (genes and/or proteins) may help cells to survive post-engraftment. As described herein, a universal donor cell line may combine properties that address both allogeneic rejection and survival post-engraftment."

            "Influenza viruses are members of the orthomyxoviridae family, and are classified into three distinct types (A, B, and C), based on antigenic differences between their nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix (M) protein. The orthomyxoviruses are enveloped animal viruses of approximately 100 nm in diameter. The influenza virions consist of an internal ribonucleoprotein core (a helical nucleocapsid) containing a single-stranded RNA genome, and an outer lipoprotein envelope lined inside by a matrix protein (M1). The segmented genome of influenza A virus consists of eight molecules (seven for influenza C virus) of linear, negative polarity, single-stranded RNAs, which encode several polypeptides including: the RNA-directed RNA polymerase proteins (PB2, PB1 and PA) and nucleoprotein (NP), which form the nucleocapsid; the matrix proteins (M1, M2, which is also a surface-exposed protein embedded in the virus membrane); two surface glycoproteins, which project from the lipoprotein envelope: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA); and nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2). Transcription and replication of the genome takes place in the nucleus and assembly takes place at the plasma membrane.",
            "Hemagglutinin is the major envelope glycoprotein of influenza A and B viruses, and hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) of influenza C viruses is a protein homologous to HA. The rapid evolution of the HA protein of the influenza virus results in the constant emergence of new strains, rendering the adaptive immune response of the host only partially protective to new infections. The biggest challenge for therapy and prophylaxis against influenza and other infections using traditional vaccines is the limitation of vaccines in breadth, providing protection only against closely related subtypes. In addition, the length of time required to complete current standard influenza virus vaccine production processes inhibits the rapid development and production of an adapted vaccine in a pandemic situation.",

The direct injection of genetically engineered DNA (e.g., naked plasmid DNA) into a living host results in a small number of its cells directly producing an antigen, resulting in a protective immunological response.

Approaches to therapeutically target the genome often rely on the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway, which enables accurate genome repair of introduced double-stranded breaks (DSBs) using exogenous single- or double-stranded DNA repair templates (e.g., donor polynucleotides), but is often highly suppressed in non-dividing cells (e.g., G phase cells) (Orthwein et al., (2015) Nature 528(7582):422-6). Despite rapid advances in this area of biomedical research and the potential for clinical applications, targeted integration of transgenes or other polynucleotides for therapeutic purposes in vivo remains challenging because current methods are inefficient, particularly for non-dividing cells, which compose most adult tissues.",
            "DSBs induced into the genome by exogenous sources (e.g., an engineered nuclease) may be repaired in cells by double-strand break repair (DSBR) mechanisms, such as the HDR pathway and the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway. The canonical HDR pathway is known to operate in dividing cells (e.g., cells in S phase), as it requires a homologous sister chromatid for execution, whereas the NHEJ pathway can function in both dividing and non-dividing cells and independent of the cell cycle (Iyama & Wilson (2013) DNA Repair 12(8), 620-636). In contrast to the HDR pathway, the NHEJ repair pathway is often used in genome editing approaches that do not employ an exogenous DNA repair template (e.g., a donor polynucleotide) and that are directed toward the formation of an stochastic insertion or deletion (\u2018indel\u2019) of one or more nucleotides at the DSB site, resulting in, for example, disruption of the translational reading frame of a coding sequence or the binding sites of trans-acting factors in promoters or enhancers.",

During the initiation phase, the RNA polymerase binds to a specific promoter DNA sequence, opens the DNA duplex and feeds the template strand into the active site. T7 RNA polymerase, for example, forms a structure referred to as initiation complex, which includes a six-helix bundle sub-domain (the promoter binding domain) that interacts with the promoter to initiate DNA duplex melting. While bound to the promoter, the polymerase produces many short (truncated) transcripts from 2-12 nucleotides (nt) in length, a process often referred to as abortive synthesis/initiation. The truncated RNA transcripts cannot be converted to full-length transcripts by RNA polymerase and become by-products that accumulate during transcription. After the transition to the elongation phase and release of the promoter, the polymerase proceeds down the DNA template producing a full-length RNA transcript.",

Studies suggest that more than 70% of transcripts generated by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro may be run-on transcripts.

Because run-on transcription is stochastic, there is often great 3\u2032 heterogeneity among products in a given IVT reaction.

        "abstract": "This invention provides for a novel means of incorporating non-native amino acids into preselected positions of a protein using a cell-free synthesis system. The methods involve the use of non-orthogonal, native isoaccepting sense tRNAs that are encoded by the genetic code. Such methods allow for numerous non-native amino acids to be incorporated through the use of sense codons without having to rely upon orthogonal tRNA-synthetase pairs.",
        "paragraph": [
            "Protein synthesis is a fundamental biological process that underlies the development of polypeptide therapeutics, vaccines, diagnostics, and industrial enzymes. With the advent of recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology, it has become possible to harness the catalytic machinery of the cell to produce a desired protein. This can be achieved within the cellular environment or in vitro using lysates derived from cells.",
            "Because only twenty amino acids are naturally incorporated into proteins, limitations to the production of a desired protein exist. For example, a peptide that is potentially useful as a therapeutic agent may be quickly degraded or otherwise inactivated upon administration to a patient as a result of proteases present within the patient. Likewise, infectious agents such as bacteria or viruses are more likely to develop resistance against peptides that contain only naturally occurring amino acids. This occurs because enzymes that are produced by the bacteria or virus that can inactivate a peptide drug are more likely to inactivate a peptide containing naturally occurring amino acids as opposed to a peptide containing non-native amino acids. Such limitations become even more apparent when compared with small organic molecule synthesis, in which any structural change can be made to influence functional properties of the compound. As a result, proteins containing non-native amino acids are becoming more auspicious for therapeutic uses. Furthermore, peptides containing non-native amino acids are extremely useful for non-therapeutic research purposes, such as uses relevant to the structural and functional probing of proteins, construction of peptide libraries for combinatorial chemistry, and proteomic studies.",
            "Although the twenty naturally occurring amino acids can be modified by post-translational modification, expanding the genetic code to include additional non-native amino acids with novel biological, chemical, or physical properties will increase the utility of the protein containing such novel non-native amino acids. Protein properties may include the size, acidity, nucleophilicity, hydrogen-bonding, or hydrophobicity of the protein.",
            "Different strategies have been utilized to synthesize peptides containing non-native amino acids. Synthetic peptide chemistry has been used routinely for this purpose. See, e.g., Eckert et al., Cell 99:103-15 (1999). However, routine solid-phase peptide synthesis is generally limited to small peptides with less than 100 residues. With the recent development of enzymatic ligation and native chemical ligation of peptide fragments, it is possible to make larger proteins. However, these methods are not easily scaled. See, e.g., Dawson and Kent, Annu Rev. Biochem. 69:923 (2000).",
            "In vivo translation using living cells is widely used for the efficient synthesis and post-translational modification of proteins from a genetically encoded natural or recombinant DNA sequence. However, folding may be inefficient if the protein is expressed in inclusion bodies. Most importantly, such methods are more difficult for the selective incorporation of multiple non-native amino acids, or to control the post-translational modification process.",
            "In vitro, or cell-free, protein synthesis offers several advantages over conventional in vivo protein expression methods. Cell-free systems can direct most, if not all, of the metabolic resources of the cell towards the exclusive production of one protein. Moreover, the lack of a cell wall and membrane components in vitro is advantageous since it allows for control of the synthesis environment. For example, tRNA levels can be changed to reflect the codon usage of genes being expressed. The redox potential, pH, or ionic strength can also be altered with greater flexibility than with in vivo protein synthesis because concerns of cell growth or viability do not exist. Furthermore, direct recovery of purified, properly folded protein products can be easily achieved.",
            "The productivity of cell-free systems has improved over 2-orders of magnitude in recent years, from about 5 \u03bcg/ml-hr to about 500 \u03bcg/ml-hr. Such improvements have made in vitro protein synthesis a practical technique for laboratory-scale research and provides a platform technology for high-throughput protein expression. It further indicates the feasibility for using cell-free technologies as an alternative means to in vivo large-scale, commercial production of protein pharmaceuticals.",
            "The incorporation of non-native amino acids into proteins remains a challenge with both in vivo and in vitro protein synthesis systems. A major hurdle in this field of endeavor is promoting recognition of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase with a non-native amino acid. An aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is an enzyme that catalyzes the bond of a specific amino acid to its cognate tRNA molecule. In most cases, each naturally occurring amino acid has one specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that will aminoacylate that amino acid to its proper tRNA molecule, which is known as tRNA charging. There exists relatively few aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases considering the fact that the degeneracy of the genetic code allows amino acids to be charged to more than one kind of isoaccepting sense tRNA molecule. Thus, the success of incorporating non-native amino acids into proteins depends on the recognition of the non-native amino acid by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which in general requires high selectively to insure the fidelity of protein translation. The fidelity of aminoacylation is maintained both at the level of substrate discrimination and proofreading of both non-cognate intermediates and protein products.",
            "One strategy has been to incorporate non-native amino acids into proteins using aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that cannot discriminate between non-native amino acids that are structurally similar to their natural counterparts due to lack of proofreading mechanisms. Because the proofreading activity of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase has been disabled, structural analogs of natural amino acids that have been misactivated may escape the editing functions of the synthetase, and be incorporated into the growing peptide chain as desired. See, e.g., Doring et al., Science 292:501 (2001).",
            "A major limitation of the abovementioned strategy is that all sites corresponding to a particular natural amino acid throughout the protein are replaced. The extent of incorporation of the natural and non-native amino acid may also vary because it is difficult to completely deplete the cognate natural amino acid inside the cell. Another limitation is that these strategies make it difficult to study the mutant protein in living cells because the multisite incorporation of analogs often results in toxicity. Finally, this method is applicable in general only to close structural analogs of the common amino acids, again because substitutions must be tolerated at all sites in the genome.",
            "More recently, orthogonal tRNAs and corresponding orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that charge the orthogonal tRNA with the desired non-native amino acid has been used as a strategy to overcome previous limitations. An orthogonal tRNA is a tRNA that base pairs with a codon that is not normally associated with an amino acid such as a stop codon or 4 base pair codon, etc. Importantly, orthogonal components do not cross-react with any of the endogenous tRNAs, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, amino acids, or codons in the host organism.",
            "A commonly used orthogonal system for the incorporation of non-native amino acids is the amber suppressor orthogonal tRNA. Using this system, a suppressor tRNA is prepared that recognizes the stop codon UAG and is chemically aminoacylated with a non-native amino acid. Conventional site-directed mutagenesis is used to introduce the stop codon TAG at the site of interest in the protein gene. When the aminoacylated suppressor tRNA and the mutant gene are combined in an in vitro transcription/translation system, the non-native amino acid is incorporated in response to the UAG codon which gives a protein containing the non-native amino acid at the specified position. See, e.g., Sayers et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 16:791-802 (1988). Evidence has shown that the desired non-native amino acid is incorporated at the position specified by the UAG codon and that the non-native amino acid is not incorporated at any other site in the protein. See, e.g., Noren et al., Science 244:182-88 (1989); Ellman et al., Science 255: 197-200 (1992). For additional discussion of orthogonal translation systems that incorporate non-native amino acids, and methods for their production and use, see also Wang and Schultz, Chem. Commun. 1:1-11 (2002); Xie and Schultz, Methods 36:227-38 (2005); Xie and Schultz, Curr. Opinion in Chemical Biology 9:548-554 (2005); Wang et al., Annu Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 35:225-49 (2006); and Xie and Schultz, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 7:775-82 (2006).",
            "However, the incorporation of non-native amino acids using orthogonal components suffers from much lower yields because it relies on inherently inefficient suppressor tRNAs competing with termination factors. In addition, the use of orthogonal components for incorporation of non-native amino acids has been restricted to selective incorporation of only a single non-native amino acid per protein at only one of the three nonsense termination codons (the UAG amber stop codon) because of competition at amino acid sense codons from natural amino acids catalyzed by the tRNA charging and proofreading activities of the twenty different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and because attempts to use a second termination codon (UGA) often fails due to read-through by the ribosome. See, e.g., Cload et al., Chem. and Biol. 3:1033-38 (1996).",
            "While some attempts have been made to incorporate non-native amino acids into proteins using tRNAs that recognize sense codons, such attempts have been made using a pure reconstituted in vitro translation system. See Tan et al., Methods 36:279-90 (2005); Forster et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,977,150. However, such pure reconstituted translation systems require purified translational components, which is impractical outside of the context of research, very expensive, and not shown to be highly efficient.",
            "There exists a need in the art for incorporating non-native amino acids into a growing polypeptide chain, where orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pairs can be avoided, where native isoaccepting tRNAs aminoacylated with non-native amino acids recognize sense codons and subsequently incorporate the non-native amino acid into a growing polypeptide chain at a position defined by the sense codon, where numerous non-native amino acids can be incorporated at defined positions, and where a crude cell-free protein synthesis system can be used that avoids the impracticality, expense, and inefficiency of a pure reconstituted in vitro translation system. The invention described herein fulfills these and other needs, as will be apparent upon review of the following disclosure."

They are caused by all types of pathogenic agents, including bacteria, parasites, fungi, viruses and prions. In regions densely populated with both people and livestock, zoonotic diseases can spread very quickly. With changes in the environment, human behavior and habitat, increasingly these infections are emerging from wildlife species. Specific examples of zoonotic viruses include Lassa virus, Nipah virus, and betacoronaviruses.",
            "Lassa Virus.",
            "Lassa virus (LASV), a segmented negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the family Arenaviridae, is endemic to West Africa. Transmission typically occurs through contact with infected rodents or virus-contaminated rodent excreta, and person-to-person transmission. The LASV expresses just one protein on its surface, termed GPC, which mediates both attachment to and entry of host cells. GPC is a class I viral fusion protein that forms trimers on the viral surface. Each monomer in the trimer is assembled by distinct GP1 and GP2 subunits that mediate receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively. Notably, on the viral surface, GP2 is coiled about the base of GP1 in a structure that is only metastable. The complex is prone to rapid disassembly of GP1 from GP2 and rearrangement of the GP2 into a much more stable six-helix bundle. The release of energy achieved by collapsing of the metastable viral-surface conformation to the much more stable six-helix bundle conformation drives fusion of viral and host membranes during infection. Because of its metastability, it is difficult to maintain GPC on its trimeric pre-fusion configuration when expressed recombinantly or even when expressed on some particle surfaces. Antibodies against the resulting separated subunits are not potently neutralizing. As a result, prior vaccine approaches that included natural GPC failed to elicit an effective antibody response, leading vaccine manufacturers to instead focus on induction of cell-mediated immunity as the most likely correlate of protection. Further, in the absence of knowledge about how to create or purify stabilized Lassa virus GPC trimeric, vaccine makers did not have the necessary reagents to evaluate the most ideal antibody responses.",
            "The structure of the viral surface GP trimer remained unknown for Lassa and all other arenaviruses until this year. After a ten-year effort in engineering LASV GPC, using the GOC to evaluate human antibody responses from survivors, several high-resolution three-dimensional structures of the Lassa virus GPC in complex with these antibodies have been identified.",

Nipah first emerged in Malaysia in 1998, initially in domestic pigs and subsequently causing severe disease in humans, eventually killing over 1000 people. New outbreaks have occurred every year since, with fatality rates ranging from 40-70%. Nipah virus is classified as a BSL-4 agent and as a Category C priority pathogen by the CDC and NIAID. The primary reservoir is Pteropus bats; however, the virus is able to infect and replicate in many mammals (Luby et al 2013; Angeletti et al 2016).",
            "There are no vaccines currently available against Nipah virus. Considering that the population of people that live in the same regions as pteropus bats is approximately 2 billion, the unmet need for a protective vaccine is high.",

They are the common etiological agents of mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections. However, novel coronaviruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can result in severe lower respiratory tract infections and high mortality. MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 within the Arabian Peninsula and since its initial outbreak, Sporadic MERS-CoV infections continue to appear within the Arabian Peninsula. The epidemiology of MERS-CoV infection in humans remains unclear and convoluted with Bats and Dromedary Camels being the major reservoirs for the virus. As of June 2016, the World Health Organization has reported a total of 1,769 MERS-CoV infections with a mortality rate of 36% and an ongoing risk of human to human transmission. The absence of a vaccine for MERS-CoV poses a severe global health threat due to its pandemic potential."

            "Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is a metabolic disorder characterized by the abnormal buildup of the metabolic byproduct methylmalonic acid in patients. MMA causes developmental delay, intellectual disability, kidney disease, coma, or even death. MMA is also referred to as methylmalonic aciduria. It has an estimated incidence of 1 in 50,000 to 100,000. Current treatment for MMA is primarily via dietary control to limit the usage of metabolic pathways that lead to methylmalonic acid formation. In serious cases, kidney and liver transplants have also been performed to provide a new reservoir of cells that can properly metabolize and remove the methylmalonic acid. However, none of these treatments completely or reliably controls the disorder. As such there is a need for improved therapy to treat MMA.",

MCM is a metabolic enzyme (E.C. 5.4.99.2) that plays a critical role in the catabolism of various amino acids, fatty acids, and cholesterol. MCM's biological function is to isomerize L-methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA, a Krebs cycle intermediate. MCM localizes to the mitochondria of cells, exists as a homodimer in its native form and is adenosylcobalamin-dependent. The precursor form of human MCM is 750 amino acids, while its mature form is 718 amino acids\u2014a 32 amino acid leader sequence is cleaved off by mitochondrial importation and processing machinery. This leader sequence is variously referred to as MCM's mitochondrial targeting peptide, mitochondrial targeting sequence, or mitochondrial transit peptide.",

For example, loss of MCM has been reported to lead to a 1000-fold increase in the methylmalonic acid. Nonetheless, there is no currently available therapeutic to treat MMA."

            "HHC is characterized by excessive storage of iron in the liver, skin, pancreas, heart, joints, and testes. It remains the most common, identified, genetic disorder in Caucasians. Although its geographic distribution is worldwide, it is most common in populations of northern European origin, particularly Nordic or Celtic ancestry, in which it occurs with a prevalence of approximately 1 per 220-250 individuals. The pathophysiologic predisposition to increased, inappropriate absorption of dietary iron may lead to the development of life-threatening complications such as cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), diabetes, and heart disease.",
            "In 1996, HFE, a gene involved in HHC, was located on Chromosome 6 (6p21.3 region) and found to contain 7 exons spanning 12 kb.",
            "It was discovered that the HFE gene has multiple allelic variants. One known mutation is a G-to-A missense mutation leading to the substitution of tyrosine for cysteine at amino acid position 282 of the protein product (C282Y). C282Y homozygotes account for 80-85% of typical patients with HHC. Allele frequencies of HFE C282Y in ethnically diverse western European white populations are 5-14% and in North American non-Hispanic whites are 6-7%. C282Y exists as a polymorphism only in Western European white and derivative populations, although C282Y may have arisen independently in non-whites outside Europe. There are two other regularly identified mutations of the HFE gene, one in which aspartate is substituted for histidine at amino acid position 63 (H63D), and the other in which cysteine is substituted for serine at amino acid position 65 (S65C). These mutations are generally not associated with iron loading unless seen with C282Y as a compound heterozygote, C282Y/H63D or C282Y/S65C.",

These mutations of other genes coding for iron regulatory proteins are thought to account for most of the non-HFE forms of HHC.",
            "The largest predicted primary translation product of the HFE gene is 348 amino acids, which gives rise to a mature protein of approximately 321 amino acids after cleavage of the signal sequence. The HFE protein is similar to HLA Class I molecules at the level of the primary structure and tertiary structure. The mature protein is expressed on the cell surface as a heterodimer with beta-2-microglobulin, and this interaction is necessary for normal presentation on the cell surface. The C282Y pathogenic variant destroys a key cysteine residue that is required for disulfide bonding with beta-2-microglobulin. As a result, the HFE protein does not mature properly and becomes trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, leading to decreased cell-surface expression.",
            "The diagnosis of HHC in individuals is typically based on finding elevated transferrin-iron saturation 45% or higher and serum ferritin concentration above the upper limit of normal (i.e., >300 ng/mL in men and >200 ng/mL in women) and two pathogenic variants on confirmatory HFE molecular genetic testing. Although serum ferritin concentration may increase progressively over time in untreated individuals with HHC, it is not specific for HHC, and therefore cannot be used alone for identification of individuals with HHC.",

            "An alternative treatment for patients diagnosed with HHC includes genome engineering. Genome engineering refers to the strategies and techniques for the targeted, specific modification of the genetic information (genome) of living organisms. Genome engineering is a very active field of research because of the wide range of possible applications, particularly in the areas of human health; the correction of a gene carrying a harmful mutation, for example, or to explore the function of a gene. Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disrupting normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unwanted effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells. Recent genome engineering strategies, such as ZFNs, TALENs, HEs and MegaTALs, enable a specific area of the DNA to be modified, thereby increasing the precision of the correction or insertion compared to early technologies. These newer platforms offer a much larger degree of reproducibility, but still have their limitations.",

            "The circulatory system permits blood and lymph circulation to transport, e.g., nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide, cellular waste products, hormones, cytokines, blood cells, and pathogens to and from cells in the body. Blood is a fluid comprising, e.g., plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets that is circulated by the heart through the vertebrate vascular system. The circulatory system becomes a reservoir for many toxins and pathogenic molecules upon their introduction to or production by the body. The circulatory system also serves as a reservoir for cellular secretions or detritus from within the body. The perpetual or aberrant circulation and proliferation of such molecules and entities can drive disease and/or exacerbate existing conditions.",
            "The efficacy of therapeutic compositions that alleviate or prevent diseases and conditions associated with the circulatory system is often limited by their half-life, which is typically up to a few days. The short half-life often necessitates repeated injections and hospitalizations. It is thought that the short half-life may be due to both renal clearance, e.g., of proteins smaller than 60 kDa, and non-renal clearance, e.g., via liver excretion or immune-mediated removal. The activity of therapies is also often limited by an immune reaction elicited against them (see, e.g., Wang et al., Leukemia 2003, 17:1583). Several approaches are practiced in the art.",
            "One approach includes the use of \u201cerythrocyte ghosts\u201d that are derived from a hemolyzed red blood cell. To prepare erythrocyte ghosts, red blood cells undergo hypotonic lysis. The red blood cells are exposed to low ionic strength buffer causing them to burst. The resulting lysed cell membranes are isolated by centrifugation. The pellet of lysed red blood cell membranes is resuspended and incubated in the presence of the therapeutic agent, for example, such as an antibiotic or chemotherapeutic agent in a low ionic strength buffer. The therapeutic agent distributes within the cells. Erythrocyte ghosts and derivatives used to encapsulate payloads, such as therapeutic agents, can shield those payloads from the immune system, but the erythrocyte ghosts themselves are subject to rapid clearance by the reticulo-endothelial system (see, e.g., Loegering et al. 1987 Infect Immun 55(9):2074). Erythrocyte ghosts also elicit an immune response in mammalian subjects. These vesicles are typically constituted of both lipids and proteins, including potentially high amounts of phosphatidylserine, which is normally found on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This leads to potential immunological reactions in the recipient mammalian subjects. The undesirable effects seriously limit the potential for therapeutic applications of technologies based on erythrocyte ghosts.",
            "Another approach for drug encapsulation includes the use of exosomes. \u201cExosomes\u201d include cell-derived vesicles that are present in many and perhaps all biological fluids, including blood, urine, and cultured medium of cell cultures. The reported diameter of exosomes is between 30 and 100 nm, which is larger than low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but smaller than, for example, red blood cells. Exosomes are either released from the cell when multivesicular bodies fuse with the plasma membrane or they are released directly from the plasma membrane. Exosome delivery methods require a better understanding of their biology, as well as the development of production, characterization, targeting and cargo-loading nanotechnologies. Attempts have been made to manufacture exosomes using human embryonic stem cell derived mesenchymal stem cells (hESC-MSCs). However, as hESC-MSCs are not infinitely expansible, large scale production of exosomes would require replenishment of hESC-MSC through derivation from hESCs and incur recurring costs for testing and validation of each new batch (Chen et al. 2011 Journal of Translational Medicine 9:47). Clinical translation is also hindered by the lack of suitable and scalable nanotechnologies for the purification and loading of exosomes (Lakhal and Wood 2011 BioEssays 33(10):737). Current ultracentrifugation protocols are commercially unreproducible, as they produce a heterogeneous mix of exosomes, other cellular vesicles and macromolecular complexes. Therefore, purification methods based on the use of specific, desired markers, such as the expression of a targeting moiety on the surface of the exosome, are required. In addition, siRNA loading into exosomes is relatively inefficient and cost-ineffective, highlighting the need for the development of transfection reagents tailored for nanoparticle applications. Further, exosomes are rapidly cleared from circulation and substantially accumulate in the liver within 24 hours of administration (Ohno et al., 2013 Mol Therapy 21(1):185), limiting their application for long-term drug delivery to the circulatory of a subject.",
            "Polyethylene glycol\u2014coated liposomes are presently used as carriers for in vivo drug delivery. A \u201cliposome\u201d includes an artificially-prepared spherical vesicle composed of a lamellar phase lipid bilayer. The liposome can be used as a vehicle for administration of nutrients and pharmaceutical agents. Liposomes can be prepared by disrupting biological membranes, e.g., by sonication. Liposomes are often composed of phosphatidylcholine-enriched phospholipids and may also contain mixed lipid chains with surfactant properties such as egg phosphatidylethanolamine A liposome design may employ surface ligands for attaching to a target, e.g., unhealthy tissue. Types of liposomes include the multilamellar vesicle (MLV), the small unilamellar liposome vesicle (SUV), the large unilamellar vesicle (LUV), and the cochleate vesicle. Liposomes as cariers of anthracycline antibiotics have been a subject of a great number of studies. As a result, liposome formulations of daunorubicin (DaunoXome\u2122) and doxorubicin (Doxil\u2122) are now commercially available. The pharmacokinetics of the liposomal forms of anthracycline antibiotics differ from that of their free forms in higher peak concentrations and longer circulations times of the drugs. The kinetics of DaunoXome and Doxil clearance from plasma is close to mono-exponential. The half-life of DaumoXome in patient plasma is on the order of a few hours. In Doxil, polyethylene glycol-coated liposomes are used. The immune system poorly recognizes such liposomes; therefore the plasma half-life of Doxil is in the order of tens of hours.",
            "Red blood cells have been considered for use, e.g., to degrade toxic metabolites or inactivate xenobiotics, as drug delivery systems, as carriers of antigens for vaccination, and in other biomedical applications (Magnani Ed. 2003, Erythrocyte Engineering for Drug Delivery and Targeting). Many of these applications require procedures for the transient opening of pores across the red cell membrane. Drugs have commonly been loaded into freshly isolated red blood cells, without culturing, using disruptive methods based on hypotonic shock. Hypotonic dialysis can induce a high degree of hemolysis, irreversible modifications in the morphology of the cells and phosphotidyl serine exposure, which has been recognized as an important parameter associated with premature red blood cells removal and induction of transfusion-related pathologies (Favretto 2013 J Contr Rel).",
            "Many drugs, particularly protein therapeutics, stimulate immunogenic responses that include B cell antibody production, T cell activation, and macrophage phagocytosis. The causes of immunogenicity can be extrinsic or intrinsic to the protein. Extrinsic factors are drug formulation, aggregate formation, degradation products, contaminants and dosing. The administration mode, as well as the drug regimen, also strongly influences how immunogenicity is assessed. That is, immunogenicity will have different effects for drugs that are given in acute indications compared to drugs to treat chronic diseases. In the latter case, patients are exposed to the drug over a longer period of time and as such can mount a complete response. Pegylation is a technology designed to prolong the half-life, as well as minimize immunogenic responses. In contrast to assumptions that polyethylene glycol (PEG) is non-immunogenic and non-antigenic, certain animal studies show that uricase, ovalbumin and some other PEGylated agents can elicit antibody formation against PEG (anti-PEG). In humans, anti-PEG may limit therapeutic efficacy and/or reduce tolerance of PEG-asparaginase (PEG-ASNase) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and of pegloticase in patients with chronic gout, but did not impair hyposensitization of allergic patients with mPEG-modified ragweed extract or honeybee venom or the response to PEG-IFN in patients with hepatitis C. Anti-PEG antibodies can be found in 22-25% of healthy blood donors. Two decades earlier, the occurrence was 0.2%. This increase may be due to an improvement of the limit of detection of antibodies and to greater exposure to PEG and PEG-containing compounds in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and processed food products. These results raise concerns regarding the efficacy of PEG-conjugated drugs for a subset of patients (Garay, Expert Opin Drug Deliv, 2012 9(11):1319).",
            "Attempts in the art to create passive half-life improvement methods focus on increasing the apparent hydrodynamic radius of a drug. The kidney's glomerular filtration apparatus is the primary site in the body where blood components are filtered, see for reference e.g., Osicka et al. Clin Sci 1997 93:65 and Myers et al. Kidney Int 1982 21:633. The main determinant of filtration is the hydrodynamic radius of the molecule in the blood; smaller molecules (<80 kDa) are filtered out of the blood to a higher extent than larger molecules. Researchers have used this generalized rule to modify drugs to exhibit a larger hydrodynamic radius and thus longer half-life, mainly via chemical conjugation to large molecular weight water-soluble polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). Numerous PEGylated protein and small molecule therapeutics are currently offered in the clinic (Pasut and Veronese, 2009 Adv Drug Deliv Rev 61(13):1177; Fishburn, 2008 J Pharm Sci 97(10):4167). Though effective in many cases in increasing circulation half-life, especially as the hydrodynamic radius of the graft or fusion increases (Gao, Liu, et al., 2009 PNAS 106(36):15231), these methods offer challenges in manufacturing and maintenance of biological effector function. Heterogeneities in conjugation reactions can cause complex product mixtures with varying biological activities, due mostly to the utilization of site-unspecific chemistries. Extensive biochemical characterization often follows precise purification methods to retain a homogenous therapeutic product (Huang, Gough, et al, 2009 Anal Chem 81(2):567; Bailon, Palleroni, et al., 2001 Bioconj Chem 12(2):195; Dhalluin, Ross, et al., 2005 Bioconj Chem 16(3):504). Furthermore, attachment of large moieties, such as branched PEGs, to reactive zones of proteins can lead to decreased receptor affinity (Fishburn, 2008 J Pharm Sci 97(10):4167).",
            "Albumin may be used to bind a therapeutic protein for increased circulation of the drug (Dennis et al, 2002 J Bil Chem 277(38):35035; Walker, Dunlevy, et al., 2010 Prot Engr Des Sel 23(4):271) to increase the apparent size of the therapeutic by engineering it to bind another protein in the blood. In this manner, the drug attains its large molecular size only after administration into the blood stream. The addition of affinity-matured serum albumin-binding peptides to antibody fragments increased their circulation time 24 fold in mice (Dennis et al, 2002 J Bil Chem 277(38):35035). This method is complicated by the dynamics of albumin recycle by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and the use of cysteine-constrained cyclic peptides for functionality. Alternatively, recombinant addition of large antibody fragments may be made to a protein drug. This may cause structural as well as manufacturing complications, e.g., because of the use of complex cyclic or large domains for functionality. Despite high affinity for albumin, they require the physical constraint of correctly forming a cyclic structure prior to use. Methods of fusing larger antibody fragments may not be amendable to proteins with an already complex folding structure or low expression yield.",
            "The potential of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, antibody-coupled T-cell receptor (ACTR) therapies and other adoptive T-cell therapies in effecting complete and durable responses has been demonstrated in a number of malignant and infectious diseases. The development of more potent T cells is limited, however, by safety concerns, highlighted by the occurrence of on-target and off-target toxicities that, although uncommon, have been fatal on occasions. Timely pharmacological intervention can be effective in the management of adverse events but adoptively transferred T cells can persist long term, along with any unwanted effects. T cells targeting differentiation antigens can be expected to also recognize nonmalignant cells that express the same antigens, resulting in adverse events. For example, melanoma patients treated with T cells targeting melanocyte differentiation antigens, such as MART-1 and gp100, often develop vitiligo and uveitis. These on-target toxicities have been observed across all forms of therapeutic approaches, including tumor-infiltrating cells, in vitro-expanded T-cell clones and TCR-transgenic cells. In general, on-target autoimmunity is associated with tumor regression and is more prominent in treatment approaches that are more efficacious. On-target but off-tumour toxicities can be immediately life-threatening. For example, patients with colorectal cancer with lung and liver metastases may develop respiratory distress within 15 min of HER2-specific CAR T-cell infusion and may subsequently die from multiorgan failure 5 days later. As T-cell therapy becomes more effective, acute toxicities have also become more evident. Cytokine release syndrome, which is characterized by fevers, rigors, hypotension and hypoxia, has been observed in a number of CD19 CAR T-cell studies as a result of large-scale T-cell activation upon the recognition of CD19+ malignant cells.",
            "There is an ongoing need to provide therapeutic compositions through the circulatory system that alleviate or prevent such diseases and conditions. There is a further a need for methods and compositions that increase the half-life, safety profile, and/or efficacy of such therapeutic compositions.

Genome engineering is a very active field of research because of the wide range of possible applications, particularly in the areas of human health. For example, genome engineering can be used to alter (e.g., correct or knock-out) a gene carrying a harmful mutation or to explore the function of a gene. Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disrupting normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unwanted effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells. Recent genome engineering strategies, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), homing endonucleases (HEs) and MegaTALs, enable a specific area of the DNA to be modified, thereby increasing the precision of the alteration compared to early technologies. These newer platforms offer a much larger degree of reproducibility, but still have their limitations.",

            "Varicella is an acute infectious disease caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV). Varicella zoster virus is one of eight herpesviruses known to infect humans and vertebrates. VZV is also known as chickenpox virus, varicella virus, zoster virus, and human herpesvirus type 3 (HHV-3). VZV only affects humans, and commonly causes chickenpox in children, teens and young adults and herpes zoster (shingles) in adults (rarely in children). The primary VZV infection, which results in chickenpox (varicella), may result in complications, including viral or secondary bacterial pneumonia. Even when the clinical symptoms of chickenpox have resolved, VZV remains dormant in the nervous system of the infected person (virus latency) in the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia. In about 10-20% of cases, VZV reactivates later in life, travelling from the sensory ganglia back to the skin where it produces a disease (rash) known as shingles or herpes zoster. VZV can also cause a number of neurologic conditions ranging from aseptic meningitis to encephalitis. Other serious complications of VZV infection include postherpetic neuralgia, Mollaret's meningitis, zoster multiplex, thrombocytopenia, myocarditis, arthritis, and inflammation of arteries in the brain leading to stroke, myelitis, herpes ophthalmicus, or zoster sine herpete. In rare instances, VZV affects the geniculate ganglion, giving lesions that follow specific branches of the facial nerve. Symptoms may include painful blisters on the tongue and ear along with one sided facial weakness and hearing loss.",
            "Varicella cases have declined 97% since 1995, mostly due to vaccination. However, an estimated 500,000 to 1 million episodes of herpes zoster (shingles) occur annually in just the United States. The lifetime risk of herpes zoster is estimated to be at least 32%, with increasing age and cellular immunosuppression being the most important risk factors. In fact, it is estimated that 50% of persons living until the age of 85 will develop herpes zoster.",

A similar, but not identical, VZV vaccine is marketed globally as VARILRIX\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline). Since its approval in 1995, it has been added to the recommended vaccination schedules for children in Australia, the United States, and several other countries. In 2007, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a second dose of vaccine before school entry to ensure the maintenance of high levels of varicella immunity. In 2001-2005, outbreaks were reported in schools with high varicella vaccination coverage, indicating that even in settings where most children were vaccinated and the vaccine performed as expected, varicella outbreaks could not be prevented with the one-dose vaccination policy. As a result, two-dose vaccination is the adopted protocol; however, even with two doses of vaccine, there are reported incidences of breakthrough varicella. Furthermore, varicella vaccination has raised concerns that the immunity induced by the vaccine may not be lifelong, possibly leaving adults vulnerable to more severe disease as the immunity from their childhood immunization wanes.",

ZOSTAVAX\u00ae contains the same Oka/Merck varicella zoster virus used in the varicella and MMRV vaccines, but at a much higher titer (>10-fold higher viral dose) than that present in both of these vaccines, as the concentrated formulation is designed to elicit an immune response in older adults whose immunity to VZV wanes with advancing age.",
            "Although the varicella vaccine has been shown to be safe in healthy individuals, there is evidence that immunity to VZV infection conferred by the vaccine wanes over time, rendering the vaccinated individuals susceptible to shingles, a more serious condition.

Likewise, persons with moderate or severe cellular immunodeficiency resulting from infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) including those diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) should not receive the varicella vaccine.

For example, heterologous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) introduced into a cell can be inherited by daughter cells (whether or not the heterologous DNA has integrated into the chromosome) or by offspring. Introduced DNA can integrate into host cell genomic DNA at some frequency, resulting in alterations and/or damage to the host cell genomic DNA. In addition, multiple steps must occur before a protein is made. Once inside the cell, DNA must be transported into the nucleus where it is transcribed into RNA. The RNA transcribed from DNA must then enter the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. This need for multiple processing steps creates lag times before the generation of a protein of interest. Further, it is difficult to obtain DNA expression in cells; frequently DNA enters cells but is not expressed or not expressed at reasonable rates or concentrations.

            "Targeted editing of nucleic acid sequences, for example, the targeted cleavage or the targeted introduction of a specific modification into genomic DNA is a highly promising approach for the study of gene function and also has the potential to provide new therapies for human genetic diseases. Currently available base editors include cytidine base editors (e.g., BE4) that convert target C\u2022G to T\u2022A and adenine base editors (e.g., ABE7.10) that convert target A\u2022T to G\u2022C. Cas9-targeted deamination was first demonstrated in connection with a Base Editor (BE) system designed to induce base changes without introducing double-stranded DNA breaks. Rat deaminase APOBEC1 (rAPOBEC1) fused to deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) was used to successfully convert cytidines to thymidines upstream of the PAM of the sgRNA. This first BE system was optimized by changing the dCas9 to a \u201cnickase\u201d Cas9 D10A, which nicks the strand opposite the deaminated cytidine. Without being bound by theory, this is expected to initiate long-patch base excision repair (BER), where the deaminated strand is preferentially used to template the repair to produce a U:A base pair, which is then converted to T:A during DNA replication. While base editing efficiency was increased, the number of indels observed also increased. There is a need for improved BEs that show high base editing activity while generating fewer indels."

Disease-causing mutations could potentially be repaired using CRISPR or CRISPR-based systems. One challenge to accomplishing this goal is delivery of the elements needed for genome editing. For example, with regard to CRISPR/Cas9, SpCas9 and sgRNA can be encoded in a DNA plasmid vector and delivered via adeno-associated virus (AAV). However due to the small packaging capacity of AAVs, it is difficult to include other elements (such as polypeptide domains, promoters, reporters, fluorescent tags, multiple sgRNAs, or DNA templates for HDR) to help achieve delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 components to cells and/or to meet desired gene editing objectives."

            "Description of the Related Art",
            "RNA transcripts have strong potential as therapeutics, but effective purification of these RNA transcripts for introduction into the body remains a problem. The current landscape for the preparative chromatographic purification of RNAs utilizes reversed phase high performance (or high pressure) liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) performed with both porous and non-porous sorbents [1]. Use of RP-HPLC presents many issues regarding process scale up. Small-particle-sized sorbents referenced lend themselves to extremely high pressure processes unsuitable for large scale unit operations. Additionally, the use of organic/flammable solvents along with high pressure liquid handling equipment can be prohibitive for large scale manufacturing. These challenges include the introduction of USP class II residual solvents (acetonitrile and methanol) into the drug substance, the potential need for an explosion proof production facility, and the many obstacles presented by large scale, high pressure processes, including cost and availability. The addition of organic solvent during purification also requires significant additional downstream processing to ensure adequate removal of the solvent from the drug substance. Introduction of ion pair reagents (e.g., alkylammonium salts) is also problematic, since this produces salt form heterogeneity as these organic salts interact with the phosphate backbone. Additional unit operations are required to remove the ion pair reagents, obtain the desired salt form, and remove residual organic solvents. Furthermore, the binding capacity of the resins contained within in the prior art for preparative RNA purification has been shown to be less than 10 mg RNA/mL resin, and in some cases having extremely low binding capacities of less than 0.02 mg/mL, which is not viable for large scale manufacturing. [6][7] These low binding capacities lead to limited process productivity and throughput and can be cost prohibitive.",
            "Previous work has also been performed using anion exchange chromatography as the method for preparative purification of RNA [2] [3]. While this has proven to work adequately for separations of short synthetic RNAs or RNA transcripts of 300 nucleotides in size or less, these methods have not been shown to work for longer RNAs or RNA transcripts of greater than 500 nucleotides in length. In addition, these methods use weak anion exchangers and operate under non-denaturing conditions. Purification techniques for longer RNAs and full length transcripts for use in therapeutics is desirable, preferably techniques that are scalable, reproducible, and thus usable for large scale manufacturing of therapeutics."

Genome engineering is a very active field of research because of the wide range of possible applications, particularly in the areas of human health. For example, genome engineering can be used to alter (e.g., correct or knock-out) a gene carrying a harmful mutation or to explore the function of a gene. Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disrupting normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unwanted effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells. Recent genome engineering strategies, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), homing endonucleases (HEs) and MegaTALs, enable a specific area of the DNA to be modified, thereby increasing the precision of the correction or insertion compared to early technologies. These newer platforms offer a much larger degree of reproducibility, but still have their limitations.",

            "RNA polymerases exhibit three phases of transcription\u2014initiation, elongation and termination. During the initiation phase, the RNA polymerase binds to a specific promoter DNA sequence, opens the DNA duplex and feeds the template strand into the active site. T7 RNA polymerase, for example, forms a structure referred to as initiation complex, which includes a six-helix bundle sub-domain (the promoter binding domain) that interacts with the promoter to initiate DNA duplex melting. While bound to the promoter, the polymerase produces many short (truncated) transcripts from 2-12 nucleotides (nt) in length, a process often referred to as abortive synthesis/initiation. The truncated RNA transcripts cannot be converted to full-length transcripts by RNA polymerase and become by-products that accumulate during transcription. After the transition to the elongation phase and release of the promoter, the polymerase proceeds down the DNA template producing a full-length RNA transcript.",

            "Varicella is an acute infectious disease caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV). Varicella zoster virus is one of eight herpesviruses known to infect humans and vertebrates. VZV is also known as chickenpox virus, varicella virus, zoster virus, and human herpesvirus type 3 (HHV-3). VZV only affects humans, and commonly causes chickenpox in children, teens and young adults and herpes zoster (shingles) in adults (rarely in children). The primary VZV infection, which results in chickenpox (varicella), may result in complications, including viral or secondary bacterial pneumonia. Even when the clinical symptoms of chickenpox have resolved, VZV remains dormant in the nervous system of the infected person (virus latency) in the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia. In about 10-20% of cases, VZV reactivates later in life, travelling from the sensory ganglia back to the skin where it produces a disease (rash) known as shingles or herpes zoster. VZV can also cause a number of neurologic conditions ranging from aseptic meningitis to encephalitis. Other serious complications of VZV infection include postherpetic neuralgia, Mollaret's meningitis, zoster multiplex, thrombocytopenia, myocarditis, arthritis, and inflammation of arteries in the brain leading to stroke, myelitis, herpes ophthalmicus, or zoster sine herpete. In rare instances, VZV affects the geniculate ganglion, giving lesions that follow specific branches of the facial nerve. Symptoms may include painful blisters on the tongue and ear along with one sided facial weakness and hearing loss.",
            "Varicella cases have declined 97% since 1995, mostly due to vaccination. However, an estimated 500,000 to 1 million episodes of herpes zoster (shingles) occur annually in just the United States. The lifetime risk of herpes zoster is estimated to be at least 32%, with increasing age and cellular immunosuppression being the most important risk factors. In fact, it is estimated that 50% of persons living until the age of 85 will develop herpes zoster.",

A similar, but not identical, VZV vaccine is marketed globally as VARILRIX\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline). Since its approval in 1995, it has been added to the recommended vaccination schedules for children in Australia, the United States, and several other countries. In 2007, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a second dose of vaccine before school entry to ensure the maintenance of high levels of varicella immunity. In 2001-2005, outbreaks were reported in schools with high varicella vaccination coverage, indicating that even in settings where most children were vaccinated and the vaccine performed as expected, varicella outbreaks could not be prevented with the one-dose vaccination policy. As a result, two-dose vaccination is the adopted protocol; however, even with two doses of vaccine, there are reported incidences of breakthrough varicella. Furthermore, varicella vaccination has raised concerns that the immunity induced by the vaccine may not be lifelong, possibly leaving adults vulnerable to more severe disease as the immunity from their childhood immunization wanes.",

ZOSTAVAX\u00ae contains the same Oka/Merck varicella zoster virus used in the varicella and MMRV vaccines, but at a much higher titer (>10-fold higher viral dose) than that present in both of these vaccines, as the concentrated formulation is designed to elicit an immune response in older adults whose immunity to VZV wanes with advancing age.",
            "Although the varicella vaccine has been shown to be safe in healthy individuals, there is evidence that immunity to VZV infection conferred by the vaccine wanes over time, rendering the vaccinated individuals susceptible to shingles, a more serious condition. In addition, there have been reports that individuals have developed chicken pox or shingles from the varicella vaccination. The vaccine may establish a latent infection in neural ganglia, which can then reactivate to cause herpes zoster.",

Also, varicella is not suitable or approved for immunocompromised patients, including persons with immunosuppression due to leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, immune deficiency disease or immunosuppressive therapy. Likewise, persons with moderate or severe cellular immunodeficiency resulting from infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) including those diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) should not receive the varicella vaccine. Thus, despite the high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with herpes zoster in immunocompromised individuals, this population is not eligible for vaccination with a live attenuated vaccine, such as ZOSTAVAX\u00ae.",

The direct injection of genetically engineered DNA (e.g., naked plasmid DNA) into a living host results in a small number of host cells directly producing an antigen, resulting in a protective immunological response. With this technique, however, comes potential problems, including the possibility of insertional mutagenesis, which could lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inhibition of tumor suppressor genes."

Methods for preparing and using such vaccines are also described.",

            "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus belonging to the  genus of the  family that was first isolated in 1953 in Tanzania, where the virus was endemic. Outbreaks occur repeatedly in west, central, and southern Africa and have caused several human epidemics in those areas since that time. The virus is passed to humans by two species of mosquito of the genus  and  . There are several Chikungunya genotypes: Indian Ocean, East/Central/South African (ECSA), Asian, West African, and Brazilian.",
            "Presently, CHIKV is a re-emerging human pathogen that has now established itself in Southeast Asia and has more recently spread to Europe. The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was introduced into Asia around 1958, and sites of endemic transmission within Southeastern Asia, including the Indian Ocean, were observed through 1996. The CHIKV epidemic moved throughout Asia, reaching Europe and Africa in the early 2000s, and was imported via travelers to North America and South America from 2005 to 2007. Sporadic outbreaks are still occurring in several countries, such as Italy, inflicting naive populations. Singapore, for instance, experienced two successive waves of Chikungunya virus outbreaks in January and August 2008. Of the two strain lineages of CHIKV, the African strain remains enzootic by cycling between mosquitoes and monkeys, but the Asian strain is transmitted directly between mosquitoes and humans. This cycle of transmission may have allowed the virus to become more pathogenic as the reservoir host was eliminated.",
            "In humans, CHIKV causes a debilitating disease characterized by fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, rash, muscle pain and joint pain. Following the acute phase of the illness, patients develop severe chronic symptoms lasting from several weeks to months, including fatigue, incapacitating joint pain and polyarthritis.",
            "The re-emergence of CHIKV has caused millions of cases throughout countries around the Indian Ocean and in Southeast Asia. Specifically, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar and Thailand have reported over 1.9 million cases since 2005. Globally, human CHIKV epidemics from 2004-2011 have resulted in 1.4-6.5 million reported cases, including a number of deaths. Thus, CHIKV remains a public threat that constitutes a major public health problem with severe social and economic impact.",
            "Despite significant morbidity and some cases of mortality associated with CHIKV infection and its growing prevalence and geographic distribution, there is currently no licensed CHIKV vaccine or antiviral approved for human use. Several potential CHIKV vaccine candidates have been tested in humans and animals with varying success.",
            "Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne ( ) member of the family Flaviviridae (positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus). Dengue virus is a positive-sense RNA virus of the  genus of the Flaviviridae family, which also includes West Nile virus, Yellow Fever Virus, and Japanese Encephalitis virus. It is transmitted to humans through  (formerly  ) mosquito vectors and is mainly found in the tropical and semitropical areas of the world, where it is endemic in Asia, the Pacific region, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The incidence of infections has increased 30-fold over the last 50 years (WHO,  (2009)) and Dengue virus is the second most common tropical infectious disease worldwide after malaria.",
            "There is no specific treatment for DENV infection, and control of DENV by vaccination has proved elusive, in part, because the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS is not completely understood. While infection with one serotype confers lifelong homotypic immunity, it confers only short term (approximately three to six months) cross protection against heterotypic serotypes. Also, there is evidence that prior infection with one type can produce an antibody response that can intensify, or enhance, the course of disease during a subsequent infection with a different serotype. The possibility that vaccine components could elicit enhancing antibody responses, as opposed to protective responses, has been a major concern in designing and testing vaccines to protect against dengue infections.",
            "In late 2015 and early 2016, the first dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV) by Sanofi Pasteur, was registered in several countries for use in individuals 9-45 years of age living in endemic areas. Issues with the vaccine include (1) weak protection against DENV1 and DENV2 (<60% efficacy); (2) relative risk of dengue hospitalization among children <9 years old (7.5\u00d7 higher than placebo); (3) immunogenicity not sustained after 1-2 years (implying the need for a 4 dose booster); and (4) lowest efficacy against DENV2, which often causes more severe conditions. This latter point is a major weakness with the Dengvaxia vaccine, signaling the need of a new, more effective vaccine effective against DENV2. Other tetravalent live-attenuated vaccines are under development in phase II and phase III clinical trials, and other vaccine candidates (based on subunit, DNA and purified inactivated virus platforms) are at earlier stages of clinical development, although the ability of these vaccine candidates to provide broad serotype protection has not been demonstrated.",
            "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Flaviviridae virus family and the flavivirus genus. In humans, it causes a disease known as Zika fever. It is related to dengue, yellow fever, West Nile and Japanese encephalitis, viruses that are also members of the virus family Flaviviridae. ZIKV is spread to people through mosquito bites. The most common symptoms of ZIKV disease (Zika) are fever, rash, joint pain, and red eye. The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week. There is no vaccine to prevent, or medicine to treat, Zika virus.",
            "Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccination is one technique used to stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses to foreign antigens, such as ZIKV antigens. The direct injection of genetically engineered DNA (e.g., naked plasmid DNA) into a living host results in a small number of its cells directly producing an antigen, resulting in a protective immunological response. With this technique, however, comes potential problems, including the possibility of insertional mutagenesis, which could lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inhibition of tumor suppressor genes."

Also provided herein are formulations for stable, freeze dried bacterial extracts that when stored at room temperature retain at least about 70% protein synthesis activity compared to undried frozen bacterial extracts.",

            "The use of bacterial extracts for generating, proteins of interest m cell free protein synthesis reactions (CFPS) has been expanding from a laboratory scale to commercial scale. There is a continuing need to make the process more economical. A part of this need includes improved methods for storing and stabilizing bacterial extracts. Prior art methods included the use of various additives; freezing and thawing; spray-drying or conventional lyophilization. Drying bacterial extract has obvious advantages of reduced volume but typically resulted in significant reduction in the ability of the extracts to generate the proteins of interest.",
            "In conventional freeze-drying (lyophilization) of bacterial extracts, vacuum pressure lowers the boiling temperature of water in the extract and enables the bacterial extracts to be dried at a lower temperature. The process reduces thermal degradation, relative to higher temperature drying procedures. Typically a pressure gradient is created within the extract, driving mass transfer as vaporization occurs, and increasing heat transfer such that a heat gradient forms. Due to the heat gradient, outer portions of the sample tend to dry first, causing the surface layer to become more isolating for interior regions of the material and preventing more rapid heat transfer. Conventional lyophilization can lower the viability of biologically-active materials in bacterial extracts.",
            "In situ vaporization provides an expansive force in the sample as water vapor escapes, maintaining a more porous structure with increased surface area for sublimation. Microwave radiation in a vacuum chamber (radiant energy vacuum) is used to remove water to dehydrate biological materials (e.g., proteins, enzymes, nucleic acids, macromolecules, etc.). In some cases, biological material is frozen at low temperature in a vacuum chamber and radiant energy applied, such that the ice in the material is sublimated. In other cases the biological material is frozen prior to entering the vacuum chamber. This microwave radiation sublimation process prevents damage to temperature-sensitive biological materials from elevated temperatures and increases the drying rate and decreases drying times, relative to conventional freeze-drying procedures.",
            "Formulations of liquid extract prior to freeze drying enable integration of non-volatile additives into the dried extract. The presence of additive(s) has been shown to improve or increase the extract stability during storage. For example, an inositol can be added to wheat germ extracts for use in cell free protein synthesis (see, U.S. Pat. No. 7,048,915)."

            "Influenza viruses are members of the orthomyxoviridae family, and are classified into three distinct types (A, B, and C), based on antigenic differences between their nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix (M) protein. The orthomyxoviruses are enveloped animal viruses of approximately 100 nm in diameter. The influenza virions consist of an internal ribonucleoprotein core (a helical nucleocapsid) containing a single-stranded RNA genome, and an outer lipoprotein envelope lined inside by a matrix protein (M1). The segmented genome of influenza A virus consists of eight molecules (seven for influenza C virus) of linear, negative polarity, single-stranded RNAs, which encode several polypeptides including: the RNA-directed RNA polymerase proteins (PB2, PB1 and PA) and nucleoprotein (NP), which form the nucleocapsid; the matrix proteins (M1, M2, which is also a surface-exposed protein embedded in the virus membrane); two surface glycoproteins, which project from the lipoprotein envelope: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA); and nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2). Transcription and replication of the genome takes place in the nucleus and assembly takes place at the plasma membrane.",
            "Hemagglutinin is the major envelope glycoprotein of influenza A and B viruses, and hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) of influenza C viruses is a protein homologous to HA. The rapid evolution of the HA protein of the influenza virus results in the constant emergence of new strains, rendering the adaptive immune response of the host only partially protective to new infections. The biggest challenge for therapy and prophylaxis against influenza and other infections using traditional vaccines is the limitation of vaccines in breadth, providing protection only against closely related subtypes. In addition, the length of time required to complete current standard influenza virus vaccine production processes inhibits the rapid development and production of an adapted vaccine in a pandemic situation.",

Respiratory diseases range from mild and self-limiting, such as the common cold, to life-threatening entities like bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, acute asthma and lung cancer.

It was isolated for the first time in 2001 in the Netherlands by using the RAP-PCR (RNA arbitrarily primed PCR) technique for identification of unknown viruses growing in cultured cells. hPMV is second only to RSV as an important cause of viral lower respiratory tract illness (LRI) in young children. The seasonal epidemiology of hMPV appears to be similar to that of RSV, but the incidence of infection and illness appears to be substantially lower.",

Its incidence peaks around 4-12 months of age, and the virus is responsible for 3-10% of hospitalizations, mainly for bronchiolitis and pneumonia. PIV3 can be fatal, and in some instances is associated with neurologic diseases, such as febrile seizures. It can also result in airway remodeling, a significant cause of morbidity. In developing regions of the world, infants and young children are at the highest risk of mortality, either from primary PIV3 viral infection or a secondary consequences, such as bacterial infections.

In older adults (e.g., >60 years), RSV infection may progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Symptoms in children are often more severe, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia. It is estimated that in the United States, most children are infected with RSV by the age of three. The RSV virion consists of an internal nucleocapsid comprised of the viral RNA bound to nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), and large polymerase protein (L). The nucleocapsid is surrounded by matrix protein (M) and is encapsulated by a lipid bilayer into which the viral fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins as well as the small hydrophobic protein (SH) are incorporated.

For example, conventional approaches for chemical conjugation to the immunoglobulin Fc domain include random coupling to naturally occurring primary amines such as lysine and the amino-terminus or carboxylic acids such as glutamic acid, aspartic acid and the carboxy terminus. Alternatively, semi-selective site-specific coupling may be achieved through N-terminal conjugation under appropriate conditions, or derivatized carbohydrates as found on Fc proteins isolated from eukaryotic sources, or by partial reduction and coupling of native cysteine residues. (E.g., Kim et al., A pharmaceutical composition comprising an immunoglobulin Fc region as a carrier, WO 2005/047337). While each of these approaches has been applied successfully, they typically suffer from varying degrees of conjugate heterogeneity, relatively low yields and sometimes, significant losses in functional activity.",
            "In addition, modifications have been made to Fc domains and/or fragments to optimize their function as carrier or conjugate proteins. For example, numerous fusions of proteins and peptides have been engineered at either the amino- or carboxy-terminus of an Fc domain and/or fragment thereof. Also, a variety of enzymes and synthetic reporter molecules have been chemically conjugated to the side chains of non-terminal amino acids as well as the derivatized carbohydrate moieties of the Fc domain. Further, polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) have been conjugated to the Fc domain for the purpose of improved half-life in vivo and reduced immunogenicity.",
            "However, there are problems associated with existing Fc-based conjugates, including adverse or less optimal effects on the specificity, efficiency, yield, solubility, and activity of the therapeutic or diagnostic molecules. There is a need for better Fc-based carrier proteins to further improve the properties of the therapeutic or diagnostic molecules conjugated thereto; in particular, to further increase their half-life in serum."

            "Interleukin-12 (IL12) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in innate and adaptive immunity. Gately, M K et al.,  16: 495-521 (1998). IL12 functions primarily as a 70 kDa heterodimeric protein consisting of two disulfide-linked p35 and p40 subunits. IL12 p40 homodimers do exist, but other than functioning as an antagonist that binds the IL12 receptor, they do not appear to mediate a biologic response. Id. The precursor form of the IL12 p40 subunit (NM_002187; P29460; also referred to as IL12B, natural killer cell stimulatory factor 2, cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor 2) is 328 amino acids in length, while its mature form is 306 amino acids long. The precursor form of the IL12 p35 subunit (NM_000882; P29459; also referred to as IL12A, natural killer cell stimulatory factor 1, cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor 1) is 219 amino acids in length and the mature form is 197 amino acids long. Id. The genes for the IL12 p35 and p40 subunits reside on different chromosomes and are regulated independently of each other. Gately, M K et al.,  16: 495-521 (1998). Many different immune cells (e.g., dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and B cells) produce IL12 upon antigenic stimuli. The active IL12 heterodimer is formed following protein synthesis. Id.",
            "Due to its ability to activate both NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, IL12 protein has been studied as a promising anti-cancer therapeutic since 1994. See Nastala, C. L. et al.,  153: 1697-1706 (1994). But despite high expectations, early clinical studies did not yield satisfactory results. Lasek W. et al.,  63: 419-435, 424 (2014). Repeated administration of IL12, in most patients, led to adaptive response and a progressive decline of IL12-induced interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) levels in blood. Id. Moreover, while it was recognized that IL12-induced anti-cancer activity is largely mediated by the secondary secretion of IFN\u03b3, the concomitant induction of IFN-\u03b3 along with other cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1) or chemokines (IP-10 or MIG) by IL12 caused severe toxicity. Id.",
            "In addition to the negative feedback and toxicity, the marginal efficacy of the IL12 therapy in clinical settings may be caused by the strong immunosuppressive environment in humans. Id. To minimize IFN-\u03b3 toxicity and improve IL12 efficacy, scientists tried different approaches, such as different dose and time protocols for IL12 therapy. See Sacco, S. et al.,  90: 4473-4479 (1997); Leonard, J. P. et al.,  90: 2541-2548 (1997); Coughlin, C.

Nonetheless, these approaches have not significantly impacted patient survival. Kang, W. K., et al.,  12: 671-684 (2001).",
            "Currently, a number of IL12 clinical trials are on-going.

Thus, there is a need in the art for an improved therapeutic approach for using IL12 to treat tumors."

Alternatively, the heterologous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) introduced into a cell can be inherited by daughter cells (whether or not the heterologous DNA has integrated into the chromosome) or by offspring. In addition, assuming proper delivery and no damage or integration into the host genome, there are multiple steps which must occur before the encoded protein is made. Once inside the cell, DNA must be transported into the nucleus where it is transcribed into RNA. The RNA transcribed from DNA must then enter the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. Not only do the multiple processing steps from administered DNA to protein create lag times before the generation of the functional protein, each step represents an opportunity for error and damage to the cell. Further, it is known to be difficult to obtain DNA expression in cells as DNA frequently enters a cell but is not expressed or not expressed at reasonable rates or concentrations. This can be a particular problem when DNA is introduced into primary cells or modified cell lines.",

RNAse III is known to digest ssRNA as well as dsRNA and in trying to remove dsRNA contaminants, the integrity of the desired ssRNA product is necessarily jeopardized.

            "Various approaches have been proposed to overcome allogeneic rejection of transplanted or engrafted cells including HLA-matching, blocking pathways that trigger T-cell activation with antibodies, use of a cocktail of immune suppressive drugs, and autologous cell therapy. Another strategy to dampen graft rejection involves minimization of allogenic differences between transplanted or engrafted cells and the recipient. The cell surface-expressed human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), molecules encoded by genes located in the human major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6, are the major mediators of immune rejection. Mismatch of a single HLA gene between the donor and subject can cause a robust immune response (Fleischhauer K. et al. \u201cBone marrow-allograft rejection by T lymphocytes recognizing a single amino acid difference in HLA-B44,\u201d N Engl J Med., 1990, 323:1818-1822). HLA genes are divided into MHC class I (MHC-I) and MHC class II (MHC-II). MHC-I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) are expressed in almost all tissue cell types, presenting \u201cnon-self\u201d antigen-processed peptides to CD8+ T cells, thereby promoting their activation to cytolytic CD8+ T cells. Transplanted or engrafted cells expressing \u201cnon-self\u201d MHC-I molecules will cause a robust cellular immune response directed at these cells and ultimately resulting in their demise by activated cytolytic CD8+ T cells. MHC-I proteins are intimately associated with beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for forming functional MHC-I molecules on the cell surface.",
            "In contrast to the wide cellular expression of MHC-I genes, expression of MHC-II genes is restricted to antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. HLA antigen genes are the most polymorphic genes observed in the human genome (Rubinstein P., \u201cHLA matching for bone marrow transplantation\u2014how much is enough?\u201d N Engl J Med., 2001, 345:1842-1844). The generation of a \u201cuniversal donor\u201d cell that is compatible with any HLA genotype provides an alternative strategy that could resolve the immune rejection and associated economical costs of current methodologies for immune evasion.",
            "To generate such a line of universal donor cell(s), one previous approach has been to functionally disrupt the expression of MHC-I and MHC-II class genes. This could be achieved through genetic disruption, e.g., of both genetic alleles encoding the MHC-I light chain, B2M. The resulting B2M-null cell line and its derivatives would be expected to exhibit greatly reduced surface MHC-I and thus, reduced immunogenicity to allogeneic CD8+ T cells. The transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) targeting approach has been used to generate B2M-deficient hESC lines by deletion of a few nucleotides in exon 2 of the B2M gene (Lu, P. et al., \u201cGenerating hypoimmunogenic human embryonic stem cells by the disruption of beta 2-microglobulin,\u201d Stem Cell Rev. 2013, 9:806-813). Although the B2M-targeted hESC lines appeared to be surface HLA-I deficient, they were found to still contain mRNAs specific for B2M and MHC-I. The B2M and MHC-I mRNAs were expressed at levels equivalent to those of untargeted hESCs (both constitutive and IFN-g induced). Thus, concern exists that these TALEN B2M-targeted hESC lines might express residual cell surface MHC-I that would be sufficient to cause immune rejection, such as has been observed with B2M2/2 mouse cells that also express B2M mRNA (Gross, R. and Rappuoli, R. \u201cPertussis toxin promoter sequences involved in modulation,\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci, 1993, 90:3913-3917). Although the TALEN B2M targeted hESC lines were not examined for off-target cleavage events, the occurrence of nonspecific cleavage when using TALENs remains a significant issue that would impose a major safety concern on their clinical use (Grau, J. et al. \u201cTALENoffer: genome-wide TALEN off-target prediction,\u201d Bioinformatics, 2013, 29:2931-2932; Guilinger J. P. et al. \u201cBroad specificity profiling of TALENs results in engineered nucleases with improved DNA-cleavage specificity,\u201d Nat Methods 2014, 11:429-435). Further, another report generated IPS cells that escaped allogeneic recognition by knocking out a first B2M allele and knocking in a HLA-E gene at a second B2M allele, which resulted in surface expression of HLA-E dimers or trimers in the absence of surface expression of HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C (Gornalusse, G. G. et al., \u201cHLA-E-expressing pluripotent stem cells escape allogeneic responses and lysis by NK cells,\u201d Nature Biotechnology, 2017, 35, 765-773).",
            "A potential limitation of some of the above strategies are that MHC class I-negative cells are susceptible to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells as HLA molecules serve as major ligand inhibitors to natural killer (NK) cells. Host NK cells have been shown to eliminate transplanted or engrafted B2M\u2212/\u2212 donor cells, and a similar phenomenon occurs in vitro with MHC class-I-negative human leukemic lines (Bix, M. et al., \u201cRejection of class I MHC-deficient haemopoietic cells by irradiated MHC-matched mice,\u201d Nature, 1991, 349, 329-331; Zarcone, D. et al., \u201cHuman leukemia-derived cell lines and clones as models for mechanistic analysis of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity,\u201d Cancer Res. 1987, 47, 2674-2682). Thus, there exists a need to improve upon previous methods to generate universal donor cells that can evade the immune response as well as a need to generate cells that can survive post-engraftment. As described herein, cell survival post-engraftment may be mediated by a host of other pathways independent of allogeneic rejection e.g., hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress. Also as described herein, genetic introduction of survival factors (genes and/or proteins) may help cells to survive post-engraftment. As described herein, a universal donor cell line may combine properties that address both allogeneic rejection and survival post-engraftment."

        "paragraph": [
            "In vitro transcription (IVT) uses bacteriophage DNA-dependent ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerases (e.g., SP6. T3 and T7) to synthesize template-directed mRNA transcripts. Problems in the IVT reaction can result in complete failure (e.g., no transcript generated) or in transcripts that are the incorrect size (e.g., shorter or longer than expected). Specific problems associated with IVT reactions include, for example, abortive (truncated) transcripts, run-on transcripts, polyA tail variants/3\u2032 heterogeneity, mutated transcripts, and/or double-stranded contaminants produced during the reactions.",
            "RNA polymerases exhibit three phases of transcription\u2014initiation, elongation and termination. During the initiation phase, the RNA polymerase binds to a specific promoter DNA sequence, opens the DNA duplex and feeds the template strand into the active site. T7 RNA polymerase, for example, forms a structure referred to as initiation complex, which includes a six-helix bundle sub-domain (the promoter binding domain) that interacts with the promoter to initiate DNA duplex melting. While bound to the promoter, the polymerase produces many short (truncated) transcripts from 2-12 nucleotides (nt) in length, a process often referred to as abortive synthesis/initiation. The truncated RNA transcripts cannot be converted to full-length transcripts by RNA polymerase and become by-products that accumulate during transcription. After the transition to the elongation phase and release of the promoter, the polymerase proceeds down the DNA template producing a full-length RNA transcript.",
            "During the elongation phase, RNA polymerase often continues to transcribe DNA beyond the point at which termination should be initiated, generating longer than expected RNA transcripts (\u201crun-on transcripts\u201d). T7 RNA polymerase, for example, adds nucleotides to the end of a transcript before \u2018falling off\u2019 the template. Studies suggest that more than 70% of transcripts generated by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro may be run-on transcripts. In some cases, these aberrant RNA products are twice the length of the encoded sequence. Because run-on transcription is stochastic, there is often great 3\u2032 heterogeneity among products in a given IVT reaction. This 3\u2032 heterogeneity is problematic for downstream applications, such as ligation reactions, which are dependent on RNA transcripts of a defined length and/or nucleotide composition."

Many of these disorders are referred to as \u03b2-hemoglobinopathies because of their failure to produce normal \u03b2-globin protein in sufficient amounts or failure to produce normal \u03b2-globin protein entirely. For example, \u03b2-thalassemias result from a partial or complete defect in the expression of the \u03b2-globin gene, leading to deficient or absent adult hemoglobin (HbA). Sickle cell anemia results from a point mutation in the \u03b2-globin structural gene, leading to the production of an abnormal hemoglobin (HbS). Hemoglobinopathies result in a reduction in the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, which can lead to symptoms such as weariness, dizziness, and shortness of breath, particularly when exercising.",

Alternatively, the DNA template used in the in vitro transcription reaction is labeled. After transcription, the product is applied to a resin that is configured to bind the label, and the RNA transcript is recovered.

Once inside the cell, DNA must be transported into the nucleus where it is transcribed into RNA. The RNA transcribed from DNA must then enter the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. Not only do the multiple processing steps from administered DNA to protein create lag times before the generation of the functional protein, each step represents an opportunity for error and damage to the cell. Further, it is known to be difficult to obtain DNA expression in cells as DNA frequently enters a cell but is not expressed or not expressed at reasonable rates or concentrations.

            "Various approaches have been proposed to overcome allogeneic rejection of transplanted or engrafted cells including HLA-matching, blocking pathways that trigger T-cell activation with antibodies, use of a cocktail of immune suppressive drugs, and autologous cell therapy. Another strategy to dampen graft rejection involves minimization of allogenic differences between transplanted or engrafted cells and the recipient. The cell surface-expressed human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), molecules encoded by genes located in the human major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6, are the major mediators of immune rejection. Mismatch of a single HLA gene between the donor and subject can cause a robust immune response (Fleischhauer K. et al. \u201cBone marrow-allograft rejection by T lymphocytes recognizing a single amino acid difference in HLA-B44,\u201d N Engl J Med., 1990, 323:1818-1822). HLA genes are divided into MHC class I (MHC-I) and MHC class II (MHC-II). MHC-I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) are expressed in almost all tissue cell types, presenting \u201cnon-self\u201d antigen-processed peptides to CD8+ T cells, thereby promoting their activation to cytolytic CD8+ T cells. Transplanted or engrafted cells expressing \u201cnon-self\u201d MHC-I molecules will cause a robust cellular immune response directed at these cells and ultimately resulting in their demise by activated cytolytic CD8+ T cells. MHC-I proteins are intimately associated with beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for forming functional MHC-I molecules on the cell surface.",
            "In contrast to the wide cellular expression of MHC-I genes, expression of MHC-II genes is restricted to antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. HLA antigen genes are the most polymorphic genes observed in the human genome (Rubinstein P., \u201cHLA matching for bone marrow transplantation\u2014how much is enough?\u201d N Engl J Med., 2001, 345:1842-1844). The generation of a \u201cuniversal donor\u201d cell that is compatible with any HLA genotype provides an alternative strategy that could resolve the immune rejection and associated economical costs of current methodologies for immune evasion.",
            "To generate such a line of universal donor cell(s), one previous approach has been to functionally disrupt the expression of MHC-I and MHC-II class genes. This could be achieved through genetic disruption, e.g., of both genetic alleles encoding the MHC-I light chain, B2M. The resulting B2M-null cell line and its derivatives would be expected to exhibit greatly reduced surface MHC-I and thus, reduced immunogenicity to allogeneic CD8+ T cells. The transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) targeting approach has been used to generate B2M-deficient hESC lines by deletion of a few nucleotides in exon 2 of the B2M gene (Lu, P. et al., \u201cGenerating hypoimmunogenic human embryonic stem cells by the disruption of beta 2-microglobulin,\u201d Stem Cell Rev. 2013, 9:806-813). Although the B2M-targeted hESC lines appeared to be surface HLA-I deficient, they were found to still contain mRNAs specific for B2M and MHC-I. The B2M and MHC-I mRNAs were expressed at levels equivalent to those of untargeted hESCs (both constitutive and IFN-g induced). Thus, concern exists that these TALEN B2M-targeted hESC lines might express residual cell surface MHC-I that would be sufficient to cause immune rejection, such as has been observed with B2M2/2 mouse cells that also express B2M mRNA (Gross, R. and Rappuoli, R. \u201cPertussis toxin promoter sequences involved in modulation,\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci, 1993, 90:3913-3917). Although the TALEN B2M targeted hESC lines were not examined for off-target cleavage events, the occurrence of nonspecific cleavage when using TALENs remains a significant issue that would impose a major safety concern on their clinical use (Grau, J. et al. \u201cTALENoffer: genome-wide TALEN off-target prediction,\u201d Bioinformatics, 2013, 29:2931-2932; Guilinger J. P. et al. \u201cBroad specificity profiling of TALENs results in engineered nucleases with improved DNA-cleavage specificity,\u201d Nat Methods 2014, 11:429-435). Further, another report generated IPS cells that escaped allogeneic recognition by knocking out a first B2M allele and knocking in a HLA-E gene at a second B2M allele, which resulted in surface expression of HLA-E dimers or trimers in the absence of surface expression of HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C (Gornalusse, G. G. et al., \u201cHLA-E-expressing pluripotent stem cells escape allogeneic responses and lysis by NK cells,\u201d Nature Biotechnology, 2017, 35, 765-773).",
            "A potential limitation of some of the above strategies are that MHC class I-negative cells are susceptible to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells as HLA molecules serve as major ligand inhibitors to natural killer (NK) cells. Host NK cells have been shown to eliminate transplanted or engrafted B2M\u2212/\u2212 donor cells, and a similar phenomenon occurs in vitro with MHC class-I-negative human leukemic lines (Bix, M. et al., \u201cRejection of class I MHC-deficient haemopoietic cells by irradiated MHC-matched mice,\u201d Nature, 1991, 349, 329-331; Zarcone, D. et al., \u201cHuman leukemia-derived cell lines and clones as models for mechanistic analysis of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity,\u201d Cancer Res. 1987, 47, 2674-2682). Thus, there exists a need to improve upon previous methods to generate universal donor cells that can evade the immune response as well as a need to generate cells that can survive post-engraftment. As described herein, cell survival post-engraftment may be mediated by a host of other pathways independent of allogeneic rejection e.g., hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress. Also as described herein, genetic introduction of survival factors (genes and/or proteins) may help cells to survive post-engraftment. As described herein, a universal donor cell line may combine properties that address both allogeneic rejection and survival post-engraftment."

            "Alagille syndrome (ALGS), also known as arteriohepatic dysplasia, is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder characterized by abnormal development of liver, heart, skeleton, eye, face and, less frequently, kidney. See, e.g., Berniczei-Royko et al.,  20:476-80 (2014); Turnpenny et al.,  20(3):251-7 (2012). ALGS patients have malformed or poorly functioning bile ducts or a reduced number of bile ducts in the liver. The prevalence of the disease is reported to be 1:70,000 births. ALGS results from defects in the Notch signaling pathway, which is due in the overwhelming majority of the cases to mutation in JAGGED1 (ALGS type 1). A small proportion of cases are due to mutation in NOTCH2 (ALGS type 2).",
            "The association between ALGS and mutations in JAGGED1 (JAG1) was simultaneously reported by Li et al.,  16(3):243-51 (1997) and Oda et al.,  16(3):235-42 (1997). JAG1 encodes a cell surface protein (GenBank Accession No. NP_000205.1 and NM_000214.2) that functions as a ligand for the NOTCH receptors, NOTCH 1, 2, 3, and 4. These receptors are transmembrane proteins, and interaction with their ligands triggers a cascade of intracellular downstream effects that result in transcription of genes that help determine cell fate and differentiation, for example segmentation boundaries in the presomitic mesoderm. Approximately 70% of JAG1 mutations are truncations, some of which have been shown to have a dominant negative effect. Boyer et al.,  116(6):445-53 (2005). Other studies have identified missense mutations in JAG1 associated with ALGS which do not have dominant negative effects. Tada et al.,  279(12):2096-107 (2012). Tada et al. also suggested that the mutations affect cell-surface localization of JAG1, but the pathology of JAG1 mutations is still being determined.",
            "The classic, i.e., pre-molecular genetic testing, diagnostic criteria was based on the five main systems involved: cholestasis due to bile duct paucity, congenital heart disease (most commonly peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis), the face (mild, but recognizable dysmorphic features), the skeleton (abnormal vertebral segmentation, most commonly in the form of butterfly vertebrae), and the eye (anterior chamber defects, most commonly posterior embryotoxon). Due to the malformed or poorly functioning bile ducts or a reduced number of bile ducts in ALGS patients, bile accumulates in the liver and leads to scarring and complications such as jaundice and puritis. No disease-specific treatment option for Alagille syndrome is currently available. Rather, current clinical management focuses on alleviating the organ specific symptoms. Pruritus can be treated with choloretic agents such as ursodeoxycholic acid and cholestyramine, rifampin, or naltrexone. Biliary diversion or partial external biliary diversion is used to alleviate liver symptoms. However, deteriorating liver function in ALGS patients often necessitates liver transplantation. The treatment of cardiac and renal symptoms follows the practice appropriate for the particular problems present. A key aspect of disease management is careful attention to nutrition to maximize growth potential, which is compromised in a significant proportion of cases."

Other aliases for Gal-1 are: galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase deficiency, GALT deficiency, and classic galactosemia. Gal-1 usually presents in neonates after lactose ingestion and causes feeding difficulties, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, hepatocellular insufficiency, hypoglycemia, renal tubular dysfunction, muscle hypotonia, sepsis, cataracts, and possibly death in the short-term. Long-term symptoms include mental retardation, verbal dyspraxia, motor abnormalities, and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Bosch A M. J Inherit Metab Dis. 29: 516-525 (2006). It has an estimated incidence of 1 in 60,000 with a higher incidence in Europe and the United States. Current treatment for Gal-1 is primarily via dietary control to limit consumption of galactose and lactose, which is metabolized to galactose and glucose, to prevent accumulation of galactose. Karadag N. et al.,  59:1139-1146 (2013).",
            "The principal gene associated with Gal-1 is Galactose-1-Phosphate Uridylyltransferase (\u201cGALT\u201d), which has two variants (NM_000155; NM_001258332; NP_000146; NP_001245261 also referred to as UDP-Glucose-Hexose-1-Phosphate Uridylyltransferase and Gal-1-P Uridylyltransferase). GALT is a metabolic enzyme (E.C. 2.7.7.12) that plays a critical role in the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism. Specifically, GALT's biological function is to convert UDP-glucose and galactose-1-phosphate to glucose-1-phosphate and UDP-galactose. Timson D J,  (2015) doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2015.06.077. GALT is expressed in a variety of tissues, primarily the liver, localizes to the Golgi apparatus and cytoplasm of cells, and exists as a homodimer in its native form. The first isoform of human GALT is 379 amino acids, while its second isoform is 270 amino acids. Both isoforms have four iron binding sites and at least one zinc binding site.",
            "A complete or partial loss of GALT function leads to abnormal buildup of galactose. For example, loss of GALT has been reported to lead to galactose levels greater than 100 mg/dL in an individual as compared to less than 10 mg/dL in normal individuals. Treatment for Gal-1 generally focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications, e.g., through diet restrictions. There are no commercial therapeutics to treat Gal-1, thus, there is a need for improved therapy to treat Gal-1."

Historically, ZIKV circulated between  species mosquitoes, non-human primates in the jungle, and episodically spilled into human populations in Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. Infection was associated with a mild, self-limiting febrile illness characterized by headache, rash, conjunctivitis, myalgia, and arthralgia. Since 2010, and especially in the context of its spread and dissemination to countries of the Western Hemisphere, more severe clinical consequences have been observed. Infection of fetuses in utero during pregnancy, particularly during the first and second trimesters, has been associated with placental insufficiency and congenital malformations including cerebral calcifications, microcephaly, and miscarriage. In adults, ZIKV infection is linked to an increased incidence of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disease characterized by paralysis and polyneuropathy. In addition to mosquito and in utero transmission, sexual transmission of ZIKV has been described from men-to-women, men-to-men, and women-to-men. Persistent ZIKV infection can occur, as viral RNA has been detected in semen, sperm, and vaginal secretions up to 6 months following infection. Thus, ZIKV is now a global disease with locally-acquired and travel-associated transmission through multiple routes in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. The emergence of ZIKV infection has prompted a global effort to develop safe and effective vaccines."

For example, genome engineering can be used to alter (e.g., correct or knock-out) a gene carrying a harmful mutation or to explore the function of a gene. Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disrupting normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unwanted effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells. Recent genome engineering strategies, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), homing endonucleases (HEs) and MegaTALs, enable a specific area of the DNA to be modified, thereby increasing the precision of the alteration compared to early technologies.

            "The use of bacterial cell-free extracts for in vitro protein synthesis offers several advantages over conventional in vivo protein expression methods. Cell-free systems can direct most, if not all, of the metabolic resources of the cell towards the exclusive production of one protein. Moreover, the lack of a cell wall and membrane components in vitro is advantageous since it allows for control of the synthesis environment. However, the efficiency of cell-free extracts can be decreased by bacterial proteins that inhibit protein synthesis, either directly or indirectly. Thus, inactivation of undesirable proteins that decrease the efficiency of protein synthesis should increase the yield of desirable proteins in cell-free extracts. For example, the inactivation of proteins that decrease the efficiency of protein synthesis should increase the yield of polypeptides having non-native amino acids incorporated at a defined amino acid residue. The introduction of non-native amino acids (nnAA) into polypeptides is useful for increasing the biological diversity and function of proteins. One approach for producing polypeptides having a nnAA incoroporated at a defined amino acid residue is to use an nnAA, aminoacylated orthogonal CUA containing tRNA for introduction of the nnAA into the nascent polypeptide at an amber (stop) codon during protein translation. However, the incorporation of nnAA at an amber codon can be inhibited by the native bacterial termination complex, which normally recognizes the stop codon and terminates translation. Release Factor 1 (RF1) is a termination complex protein that facilitates the termination of translation by recognizing the amber codon in an mRNA sequence. RF1 recognition of the amber stop codon can promote pre-mature truncation products at the site of non-native amino acid incorporation, and thus decreased protein yield. Therefore, attenuating the activity of RF1 may increase nnAA incorporation into recombinant proteins.",
            "It has previously been shown that nnAA incorporation can be increased by attenuating RF1 activity in 3 ways: 1) neutralizing antibody inactivation of RF1, 2) genomic knockout of RF1 (in an RF2 bolstered strain), and 3) site specific removal of RF1 using a strain engineered to express RF1 containing a protein tag for removal by affinity chromatography (Chitin Binding Domain and His Tag). The present disclosure describes a novel method for inactivating RF1 by introducing proteolytic cleavage sites into the RF1 amino acid sequence. The cleavage sites are not accessible to the protease during bacterial cell growth, but are cleaved by the protease when the bacterial cells are lysed to produce cell-free extract. Thus, the yield of full length polypeptides having a nnAA incorporated at an amber codon is increased in bacterial cell extracts expressing modified RF1 variants described herein."

            "A typical vaccine contains an agent that resembles a weakened or dead form of the disease-causing agent, which could be a microorganism, such as bacteria, virus, fungi, parasites, or one or more toxins and/or one or more proteins, for example, surface proteins, (i.e., antigens) of such a microorganism. The antigen or agent in the vaccine can stimulate the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a foreign invader, generate antibodies against it, destroy it and develop a memory of it. The vaccine-induced memory enables the immune system to act quickly to protect the body from any of these agents that it later encounters.",
            "Vaccine production used in the art e.g., antigen vaccine production, has several stages, including the generation of antigens, antigen purification and inactivation, and vaccine formulation. First, the antigen is generated through culturing viruses in cell lines, growing bacteria in bioreactors, or producing recombinant proteins derived from viruses and bacteria in cell cultures, yeast or bacteria. Recombinant proteins are then purified and the viruses and bacteria are inactivated before they are formulated with adjuvants in vaccines. It has been a challenge to drastically reduce the time and expense associated with current technologies in vaccine development.",
            "Another obstacle to the development of new vaccine is the constant evolution of most infectious agents, such as viruses and bacteria. Viruses often mutate their surface proteins to generate new antigens which can help them skipping the active immune system that has been immunized by vaccines containing the viruses. In contrast, bacteria acquire and mutate key proteins to evade host defense and effective antibiotic applications.",
            "For example, influenza A, B and C viruses are the etiological agents of influenza. Hemagglutinin (HA), the major envelop glycoprotein of influenza A and B viruses, or its homologue, hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) in influenza C virus, is the natural reservoir of the viruses. The rapid evolution of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the influenza virus results in the constant emergence of new strains, rendering the adaptive immune response of the host only partially protective to new infections. The biggest challenge for therapy and prophylaxis against influenza and other infections using traditional vaccines is the limitation of vaccines in breadth, providing protection only against closely related subtypes. In addition, today's length of the production process inhibits any fast reaction to develop and produce an adapted vaccine in a pandemic situation.",
            "It is of great interest to develop new vaccines as well as new approaches to combatting infectious disease and infectious agents."

            "Interleukin-12 (IL12) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in innate and adaptive immunity. Gately, M K et al.,  16: 495-521 (1998). IL12 functions primarily as a 70 kDa heterodimeric protein consisting of two disulfide-linked p35 and p40 subunits. IL12 p40 homodimers do exist, but other than functioning as an antagonist that binds the IL12 receptor, they do not appear to mediate a biologic response. Id. The precursor form of the IL12 p40 subunit (NM_002187; P29460; also referred to as IL12B, natural killer cell stimulatory factor 2, cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor 2) is 328 amino acids in length, while its mature form is 306 amino acids long. The precursor form of the IL12 p35 subunit (NM_000882; P29459; also referred to as IL12A, natural killer cell stimulatory factor 1, cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor 1) is 219 amino acids in length and the mature form is 197 amino acids long. Id. The genes for the IL12 p35 and p40 subunits reside on different chromosomes and are regulated independently of each other. Gately, M K et al.,  16: 495-521 (1998). Many different immune cells (e.g., dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and B cells) produce IL12 upon antigenic stimuli. The active IL12 heterodimer is formed following protein synthesis. Id.",
            "Due to its ability to activate both NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, IL12 protein has been studied as a promising anti-cancer therapeutic since 1994. See Nastala, C. L. et al.,  153: 1697-1706 (1994). But despite high expectations, early clinical studies did not yield satisfactory results. Lasek W. et al.,  63: 419-435, 424 (2014). Repeated administration of IL12, in most patients, led to adaptive response and a progressive decline of IL12-induced interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) levels in blood. Id. Moreover, while it was recognized that IL12-induced anti-cancer activity is largely mediated by the secondary secretion of IFN\u03b3, the concomitant induction of IFN-\u03b3 along with other cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1) or chemokines (IP-10 or MIG) by IL12 caused severe toxicity. Id.",
            "In addition to the negative feedback and toxicity, the marginal efficacy of the IL12 therapy in clinical settings may be caused by the strong immunosuppressive environment in humans. Id. To minimize IFN-\u03b3 toxicity and improve IL12 efficacy, scientists tried different approaches, such as different dose and time protocols for IL12 therapy. See Sacco, S. et al.,  90: 4473-4479 (1997); Leonard, J. P. et al.,  90: 2541-2548 (1997); Coughlin, C. M. et al.,  57: 2460-2467 (1997); Asselin-Paturel, C. et al.,  91: 113-122 (2001); and Saudemont, A. et al.,  16: 1637-1644 (2002). Nonetheless, these approaches have not significantly impacted patient survival. Kang, W. K., et al.,  12: 671-684 (2001).",
            "Currently, a number of IL12 clinical trials are on-going. Though these multiple clinical trials have been on-going for nearly 20 years since the first human clinical trial of IL12 in 1996, an FDA-approved IL12 product is still not available. Thus, there is a need in the art for an improved therapeutic approach for using IL12 to treat tumors."

            "Naturally occurring RNAs are synthesized from four basic ribonucleotides: ATP, CTP, UTP and GTP, but may contain post-transcriptionally modified nucleotides. Further, approximately one hundred different nucleoside modifications have been identified in RNA (Rozenski, J, Crain, P, and McCloskey, J. (1999). The RNA Modification Database: 1999 update. Nucl Acids Res 27: 196-197, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).",
            "There are multiple problems with prior methodologies of effecting protein expression. For example, heterologous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) introduced into a cell can be inherited by daughter cells (whether or not the heterologous DNA has integrated into the chromosome) or by offspring. Introduced DNA can integrate into host cell genomic DNA at some frequency, resulting in alterations and/or damage to the host cell genomic DNA. In addition, multiple steps must occur before a protein is made. Once inside the cell, DNA must be transported into the nucleus where it is transcribed into RNA. The RNA transcribed from DNA must then enter the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. This need for multiple processing steps creates lag times before the generation of a protein of interest. Further, it is difficult to obtain DNA expression in cells; frequently DNA enters cells but is not expressed or not expressed at reasonable rates or concentrations. This can be a particular problem when DNA is introduced into cells such as primary cells or modified cell lines. The role of nucleoside modifications on the immuno-stimulatory potential, stability, and on the translation efficiency of RNA, and the consequent benefits to this for enhancing protein expression and producing therapeutics have been previously explored.

The cell surface-expressed human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), molecules encoded by genes located in the human major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6, are the major mediators of immune rejection. Mismatch of a single HLA gene between the donor and subject can cause a robust immune response (Fleischhauer K. et al., \u201cBone marrow-allograft rejection by T lymphocytes recognizing a single amino acid difference in HLA-B44,\u201d N Engl J Med., 1990, 323:1818-1822). HLA genes are divided into MHC class I (MHC-I) and MHC class II (MHC-II). MHC-I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) are expressed in almost all tissue cell types, presenting \u201cnon-self\u201d antigen-processed peptides to CD8+ T cells, thereby promoting their activation to cytolytic CD8+ T cells. Transplanted or engrafted cells expressing \u201cnon-self\u201d MHC-I molecules will cause a robust cellular immune response directed at these cells and ultimately resulting in their demise by activated cytolytic CD8+ T cells. MHC-I proteins are intimately associated with beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for forming functional MHC-I molecules on the cell surface.",
            "In contrast to the wide cellular expression of MHC-I genes, expression of MHC-II genes is restricted to antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. HLA antigen genes are the most polymorphic genes observed in the human genome (Rubinstein P., \u201cHLA matching for bone marrow transplantation\u2014how much is enough?\u201d N Engl J Med., 2001, 345:1842-1844). The generation of a \u201cuniversal donor\u201d cell that is compatible with any HLA genotype provides an alternative strategy that could resolve the immune rejection and associated economical costs of current methodologies for immune evasion.",
            "To generate such a line of universal donor cell(s), one previous approach has been to functionally disrupt the expression of MHC-I and MHC-II class genes. This could be achieved through genetic disruption, e.g., of both genetic alleles encoding the MHC-I light chain, B2M. The resulting B2M KO cell line and its derivatives would be expected to exhibit greatly reduced surface MHC-I and thus, reduced immunogenicity to allogeneic CD8+ T cells. The transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) targeting approach has been used to generate B2M-deficient hESC lines by deletion of a few nucleotides in exon 2 of the B2M gene (Lu, P. et al., \u201cGenerating hypoimmunogenic human embryonic stem cells by the disruption of beta 2-microglobulin,\u201d Stem Cell Rev. 2013, 9:806-813). Although the B2M-targeted hESC lines appeared to be surface HLA-I deficient, they were found to still contain mRNAs specific for B2M and MHC-I. The B2M and MHC-I mRNAs were expressed at levels equivalent to those of untargeted hESCs (both constitutive and IFN-g induced). Thus, concern exists that these TALEN B2M-targeted hESC lines might express residual cell surface MHC-I that would be sufficient to cause immune rejection, such as has been observed with B2M2/2 mouse cells that also express B2M mRNA (Gross, R. and Rappuoli, R. \u201cPertussis toxin promoter sequences involved in modulation,\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci, 1993, 90:3913-3917). Although the TALEN B2M targeted hESC lines were not examined for off-target cleavage events, the occurrence of nonspecific cleavage when using TALENs remains a significant issue that would impose a major safety concern on their clinical use (Grau, J. et al. \u201cTALENoffer: genome-wide TALEN off-target prediction,\u201d Bioinformatics, 2013, 29:2931-2932; Guilinger J. P. et al. \u201cBroad specificity profiling of TALENs results in engineered nucleases with improved DNA-cleavage specificity,\u201d Nat Methods 2014, 11:429-435). Further, another report generated IPS cells that escaped allogeneic recognition by knocking out a first B2M allele and knocking in a HLA-E gene at a second B2M allele, which resulted in surface expression of HLA-E dimers or trimers in the absence of surface expression of HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C (Gornalusse, G. G. et al., \u201cHLA-E-expressing pluripotent stem cells escape allogeneic responses and lysis by NK cells,\u201d Nature Biotechnology, 2017, 35, 765-773).",
            "A potential limitation of some of the above strategies is that MHC class I-negative cells are susceptible to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells as HLA molecules serve as major ligand inhibitors to natural killer (NK) cells. Host NK cells have been shown to eliminate transplanted or engrafted B2M\u2212/\u2212 donor cells, and a similar phenomenon occurs in vitro with MHC class-I-negative human leukemic lines (Bix, M. et al., \u201cRejection of class I MHC-deficient haemopoietic cells by irradiated MHC-matched mice,\u201d Nature, 1991, 349, 329-331; Zarcone, D. et al., \u201cHuman leukemia-derived cell lines and clones as models for mechanistic analysis of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity,\u201d Cancer Res. 1987, 47, 2674-2682). Thus, there exists a need to improve upon previous methods to generate universal donor cells that can evade the immune response as well as a need to generate cells that can survive post-engraftment. As described herein, cell survival post-engraftment may be mediated by a host of other pathways independent of allogeneic rejection e.g., hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress. Also as described herein, genetic introduction of survival factors (genes and/or proteins) may help cells to survive post-engraftment. As described herein, a universal donor cell line may combine properties that address both allogeneic rejection and survival post-engraftment."

The virus is passed to humans by two species of mosquito of the genus  and  . There are several Chikungunya genotypes: Indian Ocean, East/Central/South African (ECSA), Asian, West African, and Brazilian.",
            "Presently, CHIKV is a re-emerging human pathogen that has now established itself in Southeast Asia and has more recently spread to Europe. The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was introduced into Asia around 1958, and sites of endemic transmission within Southeastern Asia, including the Indian Ocean, were observed through 1996. The CHIKV epidemic moved throughout Asia, reaching Europe and Africa in the early 2000s, and was imported via travelers to North America and South America from 2005 to 2007. Sporadic outbreaks are still occurring in several countries, such as Italy, inflicting naive populations. Singapore, for instance, experienced two successive waves of Chikungunya virus outbreaks in January and August 2008. Of the two strain lineages of CHIKV, the African strain remains enzootic by cycling between mosquitoes and monkeys, but the Asian strain is transmitted directly between mosquitoes and humans. This cycle of transmission may have allowed the virus to become more pathogenic as the reservoir host was eliminated.",
            "In humans, CHIKV causes a debilitating disease characterized by fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, rash, muscle pain and joint pain. Following the acute phase of the illness, patients develop severe chronic symptoms lasting from several weeks to months, including fatigue, incapacitating joint pain and polyarthritis.",
            "The re-emergence of CHIKV has caused millions of cases throughout countries around the Indian Ocean and in Southeast Asia. Specifically, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar and Thailand have reported over 1.9 million cases since 2005. Globally, human CHIKV epidemics from 2004-2011 have resulted in 1.4-6.5 million reported cases, including a number of deaths. Thus, CHIKV remains a public threat that constitutes a major public health problem with severe social and economic impact.",

It is transmitted to humans through  (formerly  ) mosquito vectors and is mainly found in the tropical and semitropical areas of the world, where it is endemic in Asia, the Pacific region, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The incidence of infections has increased 30-fold over the last 50 years (WHO,  (2009)) and Dengue virus is the second most common tropical infectious disease worldwide after malaria.",
            "There is no specific treatment for DENV infection, and control of DENV by vaccination has proved elusive, in part, because the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS is not completely understood. While infection with one serotype confers lifelong homotypic immunity, it confers only short term (approximately three to six months) cross protection against heterotypic serotypes. Also, there is evidence that prior infection with one type can produce an antibody response that can intensify, or enhance, the course of disease during a subsequent infection with a different serotype. The possibility that vaccine components could elicit enhancing antibody responses, as opposed to protective responses, has been a major concern in designing and testing vaccines to protect against dengue infections.",
            "In late 2015 and early 2016, the first dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV) by Sanofi Pasteur, was registered in several countries for use in individuals 9-45 years of age living in endemic areas. Issues with the vaccine include (1) weak protection against DENV1 and DENV2 (<60% efficacy); (2) relative risk of dengue hospitalization among children <9 years old (7.5\u00d7 higher than placebo); (3) immunogenicity not sustained after 1-2 years (implying the need for a 4 dose booster); and (4) lowest efficacy against DENV2, which often causes more severe conditions. This latter point is a major weakness with the Dengvaxia vaccine, signaling the need of a new, more effective vaccine effective against DENV2. Other tetravalent live-attenuated vaccines are under development in phase II and phase III clinical trials, and other vaccine candidates (based on subunit, DNA and purified inactivated virus platforms) are at earlier stages of clinical development, although the ability of these vaccine candidates to provide broad serotype protection has not been demonstrated.",

The direct injection of genetically engineered DNA (e.g., naked plasmid DNA) into a living host results in a small number of its cells directly producing an antigen, resulting in a protective immunological response. With this technique, however, comes potential problems, including the possibility of insertional mutagenesis, which could lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inhibition of tumor suppressor genes."

Genome engineering is an active field of research because of the wide range of possible applications, particularly in the area of human health, e.g., to correct a gene carrying a harmful mutation or to explore the function of a gene. Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion location of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disruption of normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unintended effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells. Common genome engineering strategies, such as ZFNs, TALENs, HEs, and MegaTALs, allow a specific area of the DNA to be modified, thereby increasing precision of the correction or insertion compared to earlier technologies.

Blood is a fluid comprising, e.g., plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets that is circulated by the heart through the vertebrate vascular system. The circulatory system becomes a reservoir for many toxins and pathogenic molecules upon their introduction to or production by the body. The circulatory system also serves as a reservoir for cellular secretions or detritus from within the body. The perpetual or aberrant circulation and proliferation of such molecules and entities can drive disease and/or exacerbate existing conditions.",
            "The efficacy of therapeutic compositions that alleviate or prevent diseases and conditions associated with the circulatory system is often limited by their half-life, which is typically up to a few days. The short half-life often necessitates repeated injections and hospitalizations. It is thought that the short half-life may be due to both renal clearance, e.g., of proteins smaller than 60 kDa, and non-renal clearance, e.g., via liver excretion or immune-mediated removal. The activity of therapies is also often limited by an immune reaction elicited against them (see, e.g., Wang et al., Leukemia 2003, 17:1583). Several approaches are practiced in the art.",
            "One approach includes the use of \u201cerythrocyte ghosts\u201d that are derived from a hemolyzed red blood cell. To prepare erythrocyte ghosts, red blood cells undergo hypotonic lysis. The red blood cells are exposed to low ionic strength buffer causing them to burst. The resulting lysed cell membranes are isolated by centrifugation. The pellet of lysed red blood cell membranes is resuspended and incubated in the presence of the therapeutic agent, for example, such as an antibiotic or chemotherapeutic agent in a low ionic strength buffer. The therapeutic agent distributes within the cells. Erythrocyte ghosts and derivatives used to encapsulate payloads, such as therapeutic agents, can shield those payloads from the immune system, but the erythrocyte ghosts themselves are subject to rapid clearance by the reticulo-endothelial system (see, e.g., Loegering et al. 1987 Infect Immun 55(9):2074). Erythrocyte ghosts also elicit an immune response in mammalian subjects. These vesicles are typically constituted of both lipids and proteins, including potentially high amounts of phosphatidylserine, which is normally found on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This leads to potential immunological reactions in the recipient mammalian subjects. The undesirable effects seriously limit the potential for therapeutic applications of technologies based on erythrocyte ghosts.",
            "Another approach for drug encapsulation includes the use of exosomes. \u201cExosomes\u201d include cell-derived vesicles that are present in many and perhaps all biological fluids, including blood, urine, and cultured medium of cell cultures. The reported diameter of exosomes is between 30 and 100 nm, which is larger than low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but smaller than, for example, red blood cells. Exosomes are either released from the cell when multivesicular bodies fuse with the plasma membrane or they are released directly from the plasma membrane. Exosome delivery methods require a better understanding of their biology, as well as the development of production, characterization, targeting and cargo-loading nanotechnologies. Attempts have been made to manufacture exosomes using human embryonic stem cell derived mesenchymal stem cells (hESC-MSCs). However, as hESC-MSCs are not infinitely expansible, large scale production of exosomes would require replenishment of hESC-MSC through derivation from hESCs and incur recurring costs for testing and validation of each new batch (Chen et al. 2011 Journal of Translational Medicine 9:47). Clinical translation is also hindered by the lack of suitable and scalable nanotechnologies for the purification and loading of exosomes (Lakhal and Wood 2011 BioEssays 33(10):737). Current ultracentrifugation protocols are commercially unreproducible, as they produce a heterogeneous mix of exosomes, other cellular vesicles and macromolecular complexes. Therefore, purification methods based on the use of specific, desired markers, such as the expression of a targeting moiety on the surface of the exosome, are required. In addition, siRNA loading into exosomes is relatively inefficient and cost-ineffective, highlighting the need for the development of transfection reagents tailored for nanoparticle applications. Further, exosomes are rapidly cleared from circulation and substantially accumulate in the liver within 24 hours of administration (Ohno et al., 2013 Mol Therapy 21(1):185), limiting their application for long-term drug delivery to the circulatory of a subject.",
            "Polyethylene glycol-coated liposomes are presently used as carriers for in vivo drug delivery. A \u201cliposome\u201d includes an artificially-prepared spherical vesicle composed of a lamellar phase lipid bilayer. The liposome can be used as a vehicle for administration of nutrients and pharmaceutical agents. Liposomes can be prepared by disrupting biological membranes, e.g., by sonication. Liposomes are often composed of phosphatidylcholine-enriched phospholipids and may also contain mixed lipid chains with surfactant properties such as egg phosphatidylethanolamine. A liposome design may employ surface ligands for attaching to a target, e.g., unhealthy tissue. Types of liposomes include the multilamellar vesicle (MLV), the small unilamellar liposome vesicle (SUV), the large unilamellar vesicle (LUV), and the cochleate vesicle. Liposomes as cariers of anthracycline antibiotics have been a subject of a great number of studies. As a result, liposome formulations of daunorubicin (DaunoXome\u2122) and doxorubicin (Doxil\u2122) are now commercially available. The pharmacokinetics of the liposomal forms of anthracycline antibiotics differ from that of their free forms in higher peak concentrations and longer circulations times of the drugs. The kinetics of DaunoXome and Doxil clearance from plasma is close to mono-exponential. The half-life of DaumoXome in patient plasma is on the order of a few hours. In Doxil, polyethylene glycol-coated liposomes are used. The immune system poorly recognizes such liposomes; therefore the plasma half-life of Doxil is in the order of tens of hours.",
            "Red blood cells have been considered for use, e.g., to degrade toxic metabolites or inactivate xenobiotics, as drug delivery systems, as carriers of antigens for vaccination, and in other biomedical applications (Magnani Ed. 2003, Erythrocyte Engineering for Drug Delivery and Targeting). Many of these applications require procedures for the transient opening of pores across the red cell membrane. Drugs have commonly been loaded into freshly isolated red blood cells, without culturing, using disruptive methods based on hypotonic shock. Hypotonic dialysis can induce a high degree of hemolysis, irreversible modifications in the morphology of the cells and phosphotidyl serine exposure, which has been recognized as an important parameter associated with premature red blood cells removal and induction of transfusion-related pathologies (Favretto 2013 J Contr Rel).",
            "Many drugs, particularly protein therapeutics, stimulate immunogenic responses that include B cell antibody production, T cell activation, and macrophage phagocytosis. The causes of immunogenicity can be extrinsic or intrinsic to the protein. Extrinsic factors are drug formulation, aggregate formation, degradation products, contaminants and dosing. The administration mode, as well as the drug regimen, also strongly influences how immunogenicity is assessed. That is, immunogenicity will have different effects for drugs that are given in acute indications compared to drugs to treat chronic diseases. In the latter case, patients are exposed to the drug over a longer period of time and as such can mount a complete response. Pegylation is a technology designed to prolong the half-life, as well as minimize immunogenic responses. In contrast to assumptions that polyethylene glycol (PEG) is non-immunogenic and non-antigenic, certain animal studies show that uricase, ovalbumin and some other PEGylated agents can elicit antibody formation against PEG (anti-PEG). In humans, anti-PEG may limit therapeutic efficacy and/or reduce tolerance of PEG-asparaginase (PEG-ASNase) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and of pegloticase in patients with chronic gout, but did not impair hyposensitization of allergic patients with mPEG-modified ragweed extract or honeybee venom or the response to PEG-IFN in patients with hepatitis C. Anti-PEG antibodies can be found in 22-25% of healthy blood donors. Two decades earlier, the occurrence was 0.2%. This increase may be due to an improvement of the limit of detection of antibodies and to greater exposure to PEG and PEG-containing compounds in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and processed food products. These results raise concerns regarding the efficacy of PEG-conjugated drugs for a subset of patients (Garay, Expert Opin Drug Deliv, 2012 9(11):1319).",
            "Attempts in the art to create passive half-life improvement methods focus on increasing the apparent hydrodynamic radius of a drug. The kidney's glomerular filtration apparatus is the primary site in the body where blood components are filtered, see for reference e.g., Osicka et al. Clin Sci 1997 93:65 and Myers et al. Kidney Int 1982 21:633. The main determinant of filtration is the hydrodynamic radius of the molecule in the blood; smaller molecules (<80 kDa) are filtered out of the blood to a higher extent than larger molecules. Researchers have used this generalized rule to modify drugs to exhibit a larger hydrodynamic radius and thus longer half-life, mainly via chemical conjugation to large molecular weight water-soluble polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). Numerous PEGylated protein and small molecule therapeutics are currently offered in the clinic (Pasut and Veronese, 2009 Adv Drug Deliv Rev 61(13):1177; Fishburn, 2008 J Pharm Sci 97(10):4167). Though effective in many cases in increasing circulation half-life, especially as the hydrodynamic radius of the graft or fusion increases (Gao, Liu, et al., 2009 PNAS 106(36):15231), these methods offer challenges in manufacturing and maintenance of biological effector function. Heterogeneities in conjugation reactions can cause complex product mixtures with varying biological activities, due mostly to the utilization of site-unspecific chemistries. Extensive biochemical characterization often follows precise purification methods to retain a homogenous therapeutic product (Huang, Gough, et al, 2009 Anal Chem 81(2):567; Bailon, Palleroni, et al., 2001 Bioconj Chem 12(2):195; Dhalluin, Ross, et al., 2005 Bioconj Chem 16(3):504). Furthermore, attachment of large moieties, such as branched PEGs, to reactive zones of proteins can lead to decreased receptor affinity (Fishburn, 2008 J Pharm Sci 97(10):4167).",
            "Albumin may be used to bind a therapeutic protein for increased circulation of the drug (Dennis et al, 2002 J Bil Chem 277(38):35035; Walker, Dunlevy, et al., 2010 Prot Engr Des Sel 23(4):271) to increase the apparent size of the therapeutic by engineering it to bind another protein in the blood. In this manner, the drug attains its large molecular size only after administration into the blood stream. The addition of affinity-matured serum albumin-binding peptides to antibody fragments increased their circulation time 24 fold in mice (Dennis et al, 2002 J Bil Chem 277(38):35035). This method is complicated by the dynamics of albumin recycle by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and the use of cysteine-constrained cyclic peptides for functionality. Alternatively, recombinant addition of large antibody fragments may be made to a protein drug. This may cause structural as well as manufacturing complications, e.g., because of the use of complex cyclic or large domains for functionality. Despite high affinity for albumin, they require the physical constraint of correctly forming a cyclic structure prior to use. Methods of fusing larger antibody fragments may not be amendable to proteins with an already complex folding structure or low expression yield.",
            "The potential of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, antibody-coupled T-cell receptor (ACTR) therapies and other adoptive T-cell therapies in effecting complete and durable responses has been demonstrated in a number of malignant and infectious diseases. The development of more potent T cells is limited, however, by safety concerns, highlighted by the occurrence of on-target and off-target toxicities that, although uncommon, have been fatal on occasions. Timely pharmacological intervention can be effective in the management of adverse events but adoptively transferred T cells can persist long term, along with any unwanted effects. T cells targeting differentiation antigens can be expected to also recognize nonmalignant cells that express the same antigens, resulting in adverse events. For example, melanoma patients treated with T cells targeting melanocyte differentiation antigens, such as MART-1 and gp100, often develop vitiligo and uveitis. These on-target toxicities have been observed across all forms of therapeutic approaches, including tumor-infiltrating cells, in vitro-expanded T-cell clones and TCR-transgenic cells. In general, on-target autoimmunity is associated with tumor regression and is more prominent in treatment approaches that are more efficacious. On-target but off-tumour toxicities can be immediately life-threatening. For example, patients with colorectal cancer with lung and liver metastases may develop respiratory distress within 15 min of HER2-specific CAR T-cell infusion and may subsequently die from multiorgan failure 5 days later. As T-cell therapy becomes more effective, acute toxicities have also become more evident. Cytokine release syndrome, which is characterized by fevers, rigors, hypotension and hypoxia, has been observed in a number of CD19 CAR T-cell studies as a result of large-scale T-cell activation upon the recognition of CD19+ malignant cells.",

Additionally, methods in the literature describing RNA analysis on CE using custom gel matrices do not have the resolution seen in High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Gel electrophoresis alone also exhibits low resolution for long polynucleotides.",
            "HPLC methods utilized for large polynucleotides, such as mRNAs, may also have inferior resolution. For example, multiple polyadenylated RNAs in the same mixture (e.g. a mixture of multiple RNAs each having the same polyA tail size) may be challenging to resolve or coelute. Furthermore, temperature-dependent recovery often results in loss of resolution with long constructs. On-column sample degradation is also commonly observed when HPLC methods are utilized."

        "paragraph": [
            "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a genus of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae, in the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae. There are currently eight species in this genus, which have been identified and classified for different mammals, including humans, monkeys, and rodents. The most studied genus is human cytomegalovirus, also known as human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), which is widely distributed in the human population. Diseases associated with HHV-5 include mononucleosis and pneumonias. All herpesviruses share a characteristic ability to remain latent within the body over long periods of time. Although they may be found throughout the body, CMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands in humans and other mammals. Other CMV viruses are found in several mammal species, but species isolated from animals differ from HCMV in terms of genomic structure, and have not been reported to cause human disease.",
            "HCMV is endemic in most parts of the world. It is a ubiquitous large enveloped virus that infects 50 to 100% of the adult population worldwide. Although generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent hosts, HCMV infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised persons, such as infants following congenital or neonatal infections, transplant recipients, or AIDS patients.",
            "Primary infection normally results in subclinical disease after which the virus becomes latent, retaining the capacity to reactivate at a later time. The virus is transmitted through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk. In particular, individuals with undeveloped or compromised immunity are highly sensitive to infection by HCMV. It is estimated that at least 60% of the US population has been exposed to CMV, with a prevalence of more than 90% in high-risk groups (e.g., unborn babies whose mothers become infected with CMV during the pregnancy or people with HIV).",
            "In healthy individuals, HCMV typically causes an asymptomatic infection or produces mild, flulike symptoms. However, among two populations, HCMV is responsible for serious medical conditions. First, HCMV is a major cause of congenital defects in newborns infected in utero. Among congenitally infected newborns, 5-10% have major clinical symptoms at birth, such as microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, and hepatitis, as well as cytomegalic inclusion disease, which affects many tissues and organs including the central nervous system, liver, and retina and can lead to multi-organ failure and death. Other infants may be asymptomatic at birth, but later develop hearing loss or central nervous system abnormalities causing, in particular, poor intellectual performance and mental retardation. These pathologies are due in part to the ability of HCMV to enter and replicate in diverse cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, neurons, and monocytes/macrophages.",
            "The second population at risk are immunocompromised patients, such as those suffering from HIV infection and those undergoing transplantations. In this situation, the virus becomes an opportunistic pathogen and causes severe disease with high morbidity and mortality. The clinical disease causes a variety of symptoms including fever, pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, myelitis, colitis, uveitis, retinitis, and neuropathy. Rarer manifestations of HCMV infections in immunocompetent individuals include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, meningoencephalitis, pericarditis, myocarditis, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. Moreover, HCMV infection increases the risk of organ graft loss through transplant vascular sclerosis and restenosis, and may increase atherosclerosis in transplant patients as well as in the general population. It is estimated that HCMV infection causes clinical disease in 75% of patients in the first year after transplantation.",
            "There is currently no approved HCMV vaccine. Two candidate vaccines, Towne and gB/MF59, have completed phase II efficacy trials. The Towne vaccine appears protective against both infection and disease caused by challenge with pathogenic Toledo strain and also appears to be effective in preventing severe post-transplantation CMV disease. However, in a small phase II clinical trial, a low dose of Towne vaccine failed to show protection against infection of seronegative mothers who had children actively shedding CMV.",
            "The gB/MF59 vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine comprised of a transmembrane-deleted version of HCMV gB protein, which induces high levels of fibroblast entry neutralizing antibodies in humans and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in both adults and toddlers. A recent phase II double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the gB/MF59 vaccine revealed a 50% efficacy in inducing sterilizing immunity. As this vaccine induces potent antibody responses but very weak T-cell responses, the partial efficacy provided by the vaccine is thought to be primarily antibody-mediated. While this HCMV vaccine is the first to show any protective efficacy, its 50% protection falls short of the 80-90% desired for most vaccines.",
            "In addition, antibody therapy has been used to control HCMV infection in immunocompromised individuals and to reduce the pathological consequences of maternal-fetal transmission, although such therapy is usually not sufficient to eradicate the virus. HCMV immunoglobulins (Igs) have been administered to transplant patients in association with immunosuppressive treatments for prophylaxis of HCMV disease with mixed results. Antibody therapy has also been used to control congenital infection and prevent disease in newborns. However, these products are plasma derivatives with relatively low potency and have to be administered by intravenous infusion at very high doses in order to deliver sufficient amounts of neutralizing antibodies.",
            "HCMV is the leading viral cause of neurodevelopmental abnormality and other birth defects in children and the costs to society are substantial. Although antiviral therapy is available, the treatment with antiviral agents is imperfect and development of a CMV vaccine is the most promising strategy for preventing CMV infection. Given that the health and economic benefits of effective HCMV vaccines are significant, the US Institute of Medicine and US National Vaccine Program Office has categorized development of a CMV vaccine as a highest priority, but no candidate vaccine is under consideration for licensure."

Progress was made towards the identification of the contaminants in nucleoside-modified IVT RNA identifying double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as being at lease partially responsible for innate immune activation. Removal of such contaminants by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) resulted in reduced IFN and inflammatory cytokine levels and in turn, higher expression levels in primary cells (Kariko et al.

Such methods, however, are not compatible for use in the preparation of mRNAs for therapeutic use, in particular, for human therapeutic use. RNAse III is known to digest ssRNA as well as dsRNA and in trying to remove dsRNA contaminants, the integrity of the desired ssRNA product is necessarily jeopardized. Thus, there exists a need for better understanding of the nature of contaminants in IVT-generated mRNA preparations, in order to better control for levels and nature of contaminants in IVT preparations. There further exists a need for improved methods of preparing mRNA for therapeutic use and for high purity compositions produced according to such methods."

Historically, ZIKV circulated between  species mosquitoes, non-human primates in the jungle, and episodically spilled into human populations in Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. Infection was associated with a mild, self-limiting febrile illness characterized by headache, rash, conjunctivitis, myalgia, and arthralgia. Since 2010, and especially in the context of its spread and dissemination to countries of the Western Hemisphere, more severe clinical consequences have been observed. Infection of fetuses in utero during pregnancy, particularly during the first and second trimesters, has been associated with placental insufficiency and congenital malformations including cerebral calcifications, microcephaly, and miscarriage. In adults, ZIKV infection is linked to an increased incidence of Guillain-Barr\u00e9-syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disease characterized by paralysis and polyneuropathy. In addition to mosquito and in utero transmission, sexual transmission of ZIKV has been described from men-to-women, men-to-men, and women-to-men. Persistent ZIKV infection can occur, as viral RNA has been detected in semen, sperm, and vaginal secretions up to 6 months following infection. Thus, ZIKV is now a global disease with locally-acquired and travel-associated transmission through multiple routes in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. The emergence of ZIKV infection has prompted a global effort to develop safe and effective vaccines."

In a preferred embodiment, the present disclosure provides compositions comprising modified mRNA encoding ABCB4 formulated in a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) carrier and derivative constructs, which are useful for treating or preventing progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3).",
        "paragraph": [
            "Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) refers to a group of familial cholestatic conditions caused by defects in biliary epithelial transporters. The clinical presentation usually occurs first in childhood with progressive cholestasis. This usually leads to failure to thrive, cirrhosis, and the need for liver transplantation. Initial treatment is supportive, with the use of agents to treat cholestasis and pruritus, including the use of ursodeoxycholic acid, cholestyramine, rifampin and naloxone. Partial external biliary diversion (PEBD) is a surgical approach that diverts bile from the gallbladder externally into an ileostomy bag, which can also be used to alleviate symptoms of PFICs. Ultimately, PFICs often lead to liver transplant when liver dysfunction becomes severe. The disease is typically progressive, leading to fulminant liver failure and death in childhood, in the absence of liver transplantation.",
            "There are three types of PFIC, each caused by mutations in different genes. PFIC type 1 (PFIC-1) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding ATPase, aminophospholipid transporter, class I, type 8B, member 1 (ATP8B1), which is also known as ATPase phospholipid transporter 8B1, BRIC1, FIC1, PFIC, and PFIC1. ATP8B1 is a P-type ATPase protein that is responsible for phospholipid translocation across membranes. PFIC type 2 (PFIC-2) is caused by a variety of mutations in ABCB11, which encodes the bile salt export pump (BSEP) protein. PFIC type 3 (PFIC-3) is caused by a variety of mutations in ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 4 (ABCB4), which encodes a floppase. There is currently no effective treatment for the underlying genetic defect that leads to PFICs."

Respiratory diseases range from mild and self-limiting, such as the common cold, to life-threatening entities like bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, acute asthma and lung cancer. Respiratory disease is a common and significant cause of illness and death around the world. In the US, approximately 1 billion \u201ccommon colds\u201d occur each year.

It was isolated for the first time in 2001 in the Netherlands by using the RAP-PCR (RNA arbitrarily primed PCR) technique for identification of unknown viruses growing in cultured cells. hPMV is second only to RSV as an important cause of viral lower respiratory tract illness (LRI) in young children. The seasonal epidemiology of hMPV appears to be similar to that of RSV, but the incidence of infection and illness appears to be substantially lower.",

Its incidence peaks around 4-12 months of age, and the virus is responsible for 3-10% of hospitalizations, mainly for bronchiolitis and pneumonia. PIV3 can be fatal, and in some instances is associated with neurologic diseases, such as febrile seizures. It can also result in airway remodeling, a significant cause of morbidity. In developing regions of the world, infants and young children are at the highest risk of mortality, either from primary PIV3 viral infection or a secondary consequences, such as bacterial infections. Human parainfluenza viruses (hPIV) types 1, 2 and 3 (hPIV1, hPIV2 and hPIV3, respectively), also like hMPV, are second only to RSV as important causes of viral LRI in young children.",

Symptoms in adults typically resemble a sinus infection or the common cold, although the infection may be asymptomatic. In older adults (e.g., >60 years), RSV infection may progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Symptoms in children are often more severe, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia. It is estimated that in the United States, most children are infected with RSV by the age of three. The RSV virion consists of an internal nucleocapsid comprised of the viral RNA bound to nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), and large polymerase protein (L). The nucleocapsid is surrounded by matrix protein (M) and is encapsulated by a lipid bilayer into which the viral fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins as well as the small hydrophobic protein (SH) are incorporated. The viral genome also encodes two nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2), which inhibit type I interferon activity as well as the M-2 protein.",

They are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of zoonotic origin. The coronavirus genera are each composed of varying viral lineages, with the betacoronavirus genus containing four such lineages. The BetaCoVs of the greatest clinical importance concerning humans are OC43 and HKU1 of the A lineage, SARS-CoV of the B lineage, and MERS-CoV of the C lineage.

        "paragraph": [
            "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a genus of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae, in the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae. There are currently eight species in this genus, which have been identified and classified for different mammals, including humans, monkeys, and rodents. The most studied genus is human cytomegalovirus, also known as human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), which is widely distributed in the human population. Diseases associated with HHV-5 include mononucleosis and pneumonias. All herpesviruses share a characteristic ability to remain latent within the body over long periods of time. Although they may be found throughout the body, CMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands in humans and other mammals. Other CMV viruses are found in several mammal species, but species isolated from animals differ from HCMV in terms of genomic structure, and have not been reported to cause human disease.",
            "HCMV is endemic in most parts of the world. It is a ubiquitous large enveloped virus that infects 50 to 100% of the adult population worldwide. Although generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent hosts, HCMV infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised persons, such as infants following congenital or neonatal infections, transplant recipients, or AIDS patients.",
            "Primary infection normally results in subclinical disease after which the virus becomes latent, retaining the capacity to reactivate at a later time. The virus is transmitted through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk. In particular, individuals with undeveloped or compromised immunity are highly sensitive to infection by HCMV. It is estimated that at least 60% of the US population has been exposed to CMV, with a prevalence of more than 90% in high-risk groups (e.g., unborn babies whose mothers become infected with CMV during the pregnancy or people with HIV).",
            "In healthy individuals, HCMV typically causes an asymptomatic infection or produces mild, flulike symptoms. However, among two populations, HCMV is responsible for serious medical conditions. First, HCMV is a major cause of congenital defects in newborns infected in utero. Among congenitally infected newborns, 5-10% have major clinical symptoms at birth, such as microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, and hepatitis, as well as cytomegalic inclusion disease, which affects many tissues and organs including the central nervous system, liver, and retina and can lead to multi-organ failure and death. Other infants may be asymptomatic at birth, but later develop hearing loss or central nervous system abnormalities causing, in particular, poor intellectual performance and mental retardation. These pathologies are due in part to the ability of HCMV to enter and replicate in diverse cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, neurons, and monocytes/macrophages.",
            "The second population at risk are immunocompromised patients, such as those suffering from HIV infection and those undergoing transplantations. In this situation, the virus becomes an opportunistic pathogen and causes severe disease with high morbidity and mortality. The clinical disease causes a variety of symptoms including fever, pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, myelitis, colitis, uveitis, retinitis, and neuropathy. Rarer manifestations of HCMV infections in immunocompetent individuals include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, meningoencephalitis, pericarditis, myocarditis, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. Moreover, HCMV infection increases the risk of organ graft loss through transplant vascular sclerosis and restenosis, and may increase atherosclerosis in transplant patients as well as in the general population. It is estimated that HCMV infection causes clinical disease in 75% of patients in the first year after transplantation.",
            "There is currently no approved HCMV vaccine. Two candidate vaccines, Towne and gB/MF59, have completed phase II efficacy trials. The Towne vaccine appears protective against both infection and disease caused by challenge with pathogenic Toledo strain and also appears to be effective in preventing severe post-transplantation CMV disease. However, in a small phase II clinical trial, a low dose of Towne vaccine failed to show protection against infection of seronegative mothers who had children actively shedding CMV.",
            "The gB/MF59 vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine comprised of a transmembrane-deleted version of HCMV gB protein, which induces high levels of fibroblast entry neutralizing antibodies in humans and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in both adults and toddlers. A recent phase II double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the gB/MF59 vaccine revealed a 50% efficacy in inducing sterilizing immunity. As this vaccine induces potent antibody responses but very weak T-cell responses, the partial efficacy provided by the vaccine is thought to be primarily antibody-mediated. While this HCMV vaccine is the first to show any protective efficacy, its 50% protection falls short of the 80-90% desired for most vaccines.",
            "In addition, antibody therapy has been used to control HCMV infection in immunocompromised individuals and to reduce the pathological consequences of maternal-fetal transmission, although such therapy is usually not sufficient to eradicate the virus. HCMV immunoglobulins (Igs) have been administered to transplant patients in association with immunosuppressive treatments for prophylaxis of HCMV disease with mixed results. Antibody therapy has also been used to control brief infection and prevent disease in newborns. However, these products are plasma derivatives with relatively low potency and have to be administered by intravenous infusion at very high doses in order to deliver sufficient amounts of neutralizing antibodies.",
            "HCMV is the leading viral cause of neurodevelopmental abnormality and other birth defects in children and the costs to society are substantial. Although antiviral therapy is available, the treatment with antiviral agents is imperfect and development of a CMV vaccine is the most promising strategy for preventing CMV infection. Given that the health and economic benefits of effective HCMV vaccines are significant, the US Institute of Medicine and US National Vaccine Program Office has categorized development of a CMV vaccine as a highest priority, but no candidate vaccine is under consideration for licensure."

Millions of people receive flu vaccines to protect them from seasonal flu each year. Vaccination can also rapidly prevent the spread of an emerging influenze pandemic.",

The antigen or agent in the vaccine can stimulate the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a foreign invader, generate antibodies against it, destroy it and develop a memory of it. The vaccine-induced memory enables the immune system to act quickly to protect the body from any of these agents that it later encounters.",
            "Vaccine production used in the art e.g., antigen vaccine production, has several stages, including the generation of antigens, antigen purification and inactivation, and vaccine formulation. First, the antigen is generated through culturing viruses in cell lines, growing bacteria in bioreactors, or producing recombinant proteins derived from viruses and bacteria in cell cultures, yeast or bacteria. Recombinant proteins are then purified and the viruses and bacteria are inactivated before they are formulated with adjuvants in vaccines. It has been a challenge to drastically reduce the time and expense associated with current technologies in vaccine development.",
            "Another obstacle to the development of new vaccine is the constant evolution of most infectious agents, such as viruses and bacteria. Viruses often mutate their surface proteins to generate new antigens which can help them skipping the active immune system that has been immunized by vaccines containing the viruses. In contrast, bacteria acquire and mutate key proteins to evade host defense and effective antibiotic applications.",
            "For example, influenza A, B and C viruses are the etiological agents of influenza. Hemagglutinin (HA) , the major envelop glycoprotein of influenza A and B viruses, or its homologue, hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) in influenza C virus, is the natural reservoir of the viruses. The rapid evolution of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the influenza virus results in the constant emergence of new strains, rendering the adaptive immune response of the host only partially protective to new infections. The biggest challenge for therapy and prophylaxis against influenza and other infections using traditional vaccines is the limitation of vaccines in breadth, providing protection only against closely related subtypes. In addition, today's length of the production process inhibits any fast reaction to develop and produce an adapted vaccine in a pandemic situation.",

            "Early work showed that incorporation of modified nucleosides, in particular, pseudouridine, reduced innate immune activation and increased translation of mRNA, but residual induction of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines remained (Kariko et al.

Progress was made towards the identification of the contaminants in nucleoside-modified IVT RNA identifying double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as being at lease partially responsible for innate immune activation. Removal of such contaminants by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) resulted in reduced IFN and inflammatory cytokine levels and in turn, higher expression levels in primary cells (Kariko et al.

The method purports to result in preparations having decreased levels of dsRNA and increased levels of intact ssRNA, as evidenced by higher levels of reprogramming factors and less toxicity to cells. Such methods, however, are not compatible for use in the preparation of mRNAs for therapeutic use, in particular, for human therapeutic use. RNAse III is known to digest ssRNA as well as dsRNA and in trying to remove dsRNA contaminants, the integrity of the desired ssRNA product is necessarily jeopardized. Thus, there exists a need for better understanding of the nature of contaminants in IVT-generated mRNA preparations, in order to better control for levels and nature of contaminants in IVT preparations. There further exists a need for improved methods of preparing mRNA for therapeutic use and for high purity compositions produced according to such methods."

            "Genome engineering refers to strategies and techniques for the targeted, specific modification of the genetic information (genome) of living organisms. Genome engineering is an active field of research because of the wide range of possible applications, particularly in the area of human health, e.g., to correct a gene carrying a harmful mutation or to explore the function of a gene. Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion location of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disruption of normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unintended effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells. Common genome engineering strategies, such as ZFNs, TALENs, HEs, and MegaTALs, allow a specific area of the DNA to be modified, thereby increasing precision of the correction or insertion compared to earlier technologies. These platforms offer a greater degree of reproducibility, but limitations remain.",
            "Despite efforts from researchers and medical professionals worldwide to address genetic disorders, and despite the promise of previous genome engineering approaches, there remains a long-felt need to develop safe and effective universal donor cells in support of cell therapy treatments involving regenerative medicine and/or immuno-oncology related indications."

            "Vaccination is an effective way to provide phrophylactic protection against infectious diseases, including, but not limited to, viral, bacterial, and/or parasitic diseases, such as influenza, AIDS, hepatotisis virus infection, cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, and many other diseases. For example, influenza infections are the seventh leading cause of death in the United States with 200,000 hospitalizations and 40,000 deaths seen in the United States per year and cause about 3-5 million hospitalizations and about 300,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide per year. Millions of people receive flu vaccines to protect them from seasonal flu each year. Vaccination can also rapidly prevent the spread of an emerging influenze pandemic.",
            "A typical vaccine contains an agent that resembles a weakened or dead form of the disease-causing agent, which could be a microorganism, such as bacteria, virus, fungi, parasites, or one or more toxins and/or one or more proteins, for example, surface proteins, (i.e., antigens) of such a microorganism. The antigen or agent in the vaccine can stimulate the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a foreign invader, generate antibodies against it, destroy it and develop a memory of it. The vaccine-induced memory enables the immune system to act quickly to protect the body from any of these agents that it later encounters.",
            "Vaccine production used in the art e.g., antigen vaccine production, has several stages, including the generation of antigens, antigen purification and inactivation, and vaccine formulation. First, the antigen is generated through culturing viruses in cell lines, growing bacteria in bioreactors, or producing recombinant proteins derived from viruses and bacteria in cell cultures, yeast or bacteria. Recombinant proteins are then purified and the viruses and bacteria are inactivated before they are formulated with adjuvants in vaccines. It has been a challenge to drastically reduce the time and expense associated with current technologies in vaccine development.",
            "Another obstacle to the development of new vaccine is the constant evolution of most infectious agents, such as viruses and bacteria. Viruses often mutate their surface proteins to generate new antigens which can help them skipping the active immune system that has been immunized by vaccines containing the viruses. In contrast, bacteria acquire and mutate key proteins to evade host defense and effective antibiotic applications.",
            "For example, influenza A, B and C viruses are the etiological agents of influenza. Hemagglutinin (HA), the major envelop glycoprotein of influenza A and B viruses, or its homologue, hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) in influenza C virus, is the natural reservoir of the viruses. The rapid evolution of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the influenza virus results in the constant emergence of new strains, rendering the adaptive immune response of the host only partially protective to new infections. The biggest challenge for therapy and prophylaxis against influenza and other infections using traditional vaccines is the limitation of vaccines in breadth, providing protection only against closely related subtypes. In addition, today's length of the production process inhibits any fast reaction to develop and produce an adapted vaccine in a pandemic situation.",
            "It is of great interest to develop new vaccines as well as new approaches to combatting infectious disease and infectious agents."

            "There are many challenges associated with the delivery of nucleic acids to affect a desired response in a biological system. Nucleic acid based therapeutics have enormous potential but there remains a need for more effective delivery of nucleic acids to appropriate sites within a cell or organism in order to realize this potential. Therapeutic nucleic acids include, e.g., messenger RNA (mRNA), antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, DNAzymes, plasmids, immune stimulating nucleic acids, antagomir, antimir, mimic, supermir, and aptamers. Some nucleic acids, such as mRNA or plasmids, can be used to effect expression of specific cellular products as would be useful in the treatment of, for example, diseases related to a deficiency of a protein or enzyme. The therapeutic applications of translatable nucleotide delivery are extremely broad as constructs can be synthesized to produce any chosen protein sequence, whether or not indigenous to the system. The expression products of the nucleic acid can augment existing levels of protein, replace missing or non-functional versions of a protein, or introduce new protein and associated functionality in a cell or organism.",

The therapeutic applications of miRNA inhibition are extremely broad as constructs can be synthesized to inhibit one or more miRNA that would in turn regulate the expression of mRNA products. The inhibition of endogenous miRNA can augment its downstream target endogenous protein expression and restore proper function in a cell or organism as a means to treat disease associated to a specific miRNA or a group of miRNA.",
            "Other nucleic acids can down-regulate intracellular levels of specific mRNA and, as a result, down-regulate the synthesis of the corresponding proteins through processes such as RNA interference (RNAi) or complementary binding of antisense RNA. The therapeutic applications of antisense oligonucleotide and RNAi are also extremely broad, since oligonucleotide constructs can be synthesized with any nucleotide sequence directed against a target mRNA. Targets may include mRNAs from normal cells, mRNAs associated with disease-states, such as cancer, and mRNAs of infectious agents, such as viruses. To date, antisense oligonucleotide constructs have shown the ability to specifically down-regulate target proteins through degradation of the cognate mRNA in both in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, antisense oligonucleotide constructs are currently being evaluated in clinical studies.",
            "However, two problems currently face the use of oligonucleotides in therapeutic contexts. First, free RNAs are susceptible to nuclease digestion in plasma. Second, free RNAs have limited ability to gain access to the intracellular compartment where the relevant translation machinery resides. Lipid nanoparticles formed from cationic lipids with other lipid components, such as neutral lipids, cholesterol, PEG, PEGylated lipids, and oligonucleotides have been used to block degradation of the RNAs in plasma and facilitate the cellular uptake of the oligonucleotides.",

Preferably, these lipid nanoparticles would provide optimal drug:lipid ratios, protect the nucleic acid from degradation and clearance in serum, be suitable for systemic or local delivery, and provide intracellular delivery of the nucleic acid. In addition, these lipid-nucleic acid particles should be well-tolerated and provide an adequate therapeutic index, such that patient treatment at an effective dose of the nucleic acid is not associated with unacceptable toxicity and/or risk to the patient.

Blood is a fluid comprising, e.g., plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets that is circulated by the heart through the vertebrate vascular system. The circulatory system becomes a reservoir for many toxins and pathogenic molecules upon their introduction to or production by the body. The circulatory system also serves as a reservoir for cellular secretions or detritus from within the body. The perpetual or aberrant circulation and proliferation of such molecules and entities can drive disease and/or exacerbate existing conditions.",
            "The efficacy of therapeutic compositions that alleviate or prevent diseases and conditions associated with the circulatory system is often limited by their half-life, which is typically up to a few days. The short half-life often necessitates repeated injections and hospitalizations. It is thought that the short half-life may be due to both renal clearance, e.g., of proteins smaller than 60 kDa, and non-renal clearance, e.g., via liver excretion or immune-mediated removal. The activity of therapies is also often limited by an immune reaction elicited against them (see, e.g., Wang et al., Leukemia 2003, 17:1583). Several approaches are practiced in the art.",
            "One approach includes the use of \u201cerythrocyte ghosts\u201d that are derived from a hemolyzed red blood cell. To prepare erythrocyte ghosts, red blood cells undergo hypotonic lysis. The red blood cells are exposed to low ionic strength buffer causing them to burst. The resulting lysed cell membranes are isolated by centrifugation. The pellet of lysed red blood cell membranes is resuspended and incubated in the presence of the therapeutic agent, for example, such as an antibiotic or chemotherapeutic agent in a low ionic strength buffer. The therapeutic agent distributes within the cells. Erythrocyte ghosts and derivatives used to encapsulate payloads, such as therapeutic agents, can shield those payloads from the immune system, but the erythrocyte ghosts themselves are subject to rapid clearance by the reticulo-endothelial system (see, e.g., Loegering et al. 1987 Infect Immun 55(9):2074). Erythrocyte ghosts also elicit an immune response in mammalian subjects. These vesicles are typically constituted of both lipids and proteins, including potentially high amounts of phosphatidylserine, which is normally found on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This leads to potential immunological reactions in the recipient mammalian subjects. The undesirable effects seriously limit the potential for therapeutic applications of technologies based on erythrocyte ghosts.",
            "Another approach for drug encapsulation includes the use of exosomes. \u201cExosomes\u201d include cell-derived vesicles that are present in many and perhaps all biological fluids, including blood, urine, and cultured medium of cell cultures. The reported diameter of exosomes is between 30 and 100 nm, which is larger than low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but smaller than, for example, red blood cells. Exosomes are either released from the cell when multivesicular bodies fuse with the plasma membrane or they are released directly from the plasma membrane. Exosome delivery methods require a better understanding of their biology, as well as the development of production, characterization, targeting and cargo-loading nanotechnologies. Attempts have been made to manufacture exosomes using human embryonic stem cell derived mesenchymal stem cells (hESC-MSCs). However, as hESC-MSCs are not infinitely expansible, large scale production of exosomes would require replenishment of hESC-MSC through derivation from hESCs and incur recurring costs for testing and validation of each new batch (Chen et al. 2011 Journal of Translational Medicine 9:47). Clinical translation is also hindered by the lack of suitable and scalable nanotechnologies for the purification and loading of exosomes (Lakhal and Wood 2011 BioEssays 33(10):737). Current ultracentrifugation protocols are commercially unreproducible, as they produce a heterogeneous mix of exosomes, other cellular vesicles and macromolecular complexes. Therefore, purification methods based on the use of specific, desired markers, such as the expression of a targeting moiety on the surface of the exosome, are required. In addition, siRNA loading into exosomes is relatively inefficient and cost-ineffective, highlighting the need for the development of transfection reagents tailored for nanoparticle applications. Further, exosomes are rapidly cleared from circulation and substantially accumulate in the liver within 24 hours of administration (Ohno et al., 2013 Mol Therapy 21(1):185), limiting their application for long-term drug delivery to the circulatory of a subject.",
            "Polyethylene glycol-coated liposomes are presently used as carriers for in vivo drug delivery. A \u201cliposome\u201d includes an artificially-prepared spherical vesicle composed of a lamellar phase lipid bilayer. The liposome can be used as a vehicle for administration of nutrients and pharmaceutical agents. Liposomes can be prepared by disrupting biological membranes, e.g., by sonication. Liposomes are often composed of phosphatidylcholine-enriched phospholipids and may also contain mixed lipid chains with surfactant properties such as egg phosphatidylethanolamine. A liposome design may employ surface ligands for attaching to a target, e.g., unhealthy tissue. Types of liposomes include the multilamellar vesicle (MLV), the small unilamellar liposome vesicle (SUV), the large unilamellar vesicle (LUV), and the cochleate vesicle. Liposomes as carriers of anthracycline antibiotics have been a subject of a great number of studies. As a result, liposome formulations of daunorubicin (DaunoXome\u2122) and doxorubicin (Doxil\u2122) are now commercially available. The pharmacokinetics of the liposomal forms of anthracycline antibiotics differ from that of their free forms in higher peak concentrations and longer circulations times of the drugs. The kinetics of DaunoXome and Doxil clearance from plasma is close to mono-exponential. The half-life of DaumoXome in patient plasma is on the order of a few hours. In Doxil, polyethylene glycol-coated liposomes are used. The immune system poorly recognizes such liposomes; therefore the plasma half-life of Doxil is in the order of tens of hours.",
            "Red blood cells have been considered for use, e.g., to degrade toxic metabolites or inactivate xenobiotics, as drug delivery systems, as carriers of antigens for vaccination, and in other biomedical applications (Magnani Ed. 2003, Erythrocyte Engineering for Drug Delivery and Targeting). Many of these applications require procedures for the transient opening of pores across the red cell membrane. Drugs have commonly been loaded into freshly isolated red blood cells, without culturing, using disruptive methods based on hypotonic shock. Hypotonic dialysis can induce a high degree of hemolysis, irreversible modifications in the morphology of the cells and phosphotidyl serine exposure, which has been recognized as an important parameter associated with premature red blood cells removal and induction of transfusion-related pathologies (Favretto 2013 J Contr Rel).",
            "Many drugs, particularly protein therapeutics, stimulate immunogenic responses that include B cell antibody production, T cell activation, and macrophage phagocytosis. The causes of immunogenicity can be extrinsic or intrinsic to the protein. Extrinsic factors are drug formulation, aggregate formation, degradation products, contaminants and dosing. The administration mode, as well as the drug regimen, also strongly influences how immunogenicity is assessed. That is, immunogenicity will have different effects for drugs that are given in acute indications compared to drugs to treat chronic diseases. In the latter case, patients are exposed to the drug over a longer period of time and as such can mount a complete response. Pegylation is a technology designed to prolong the half-life, as well as minimize immunogenic responses. In contrast to assumptions that polyethylene glycol (PEG) is non-immunogenic and non-antigenic, certain animal studies show that uricase, ovalbumin and some other PEGylated agents can elicit antibody formation against PEG (anti-PEG). In humans, anti-PEG may limit therapeutic efficacy and/or reduce tolerance of PEG-asparaginase (PEG-ASNase) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and of pegloticase in patients with chronic gout, but did not impair hyposensitization of allergic patients with mPEG-modified ragweed extract or honeybee venom or the response to PEG-IFN in patients with hepatitis C. Anti-PEG antibodies can be found in 22-25% of healthy blood donors. Two decades earlier, the occurrence was 0.2%. This increase may be due to an improvement of the limit of detection of antibodies and to greater exposure to PEG and PEG-containing compounds in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and processed food products. These results raise concerns regarding the efficacy of PEG-conjugated drugs for a subset of patients (Garay, Expert Opin Drug Deliv, 2012 9(11):1319).",
            "Attempts in the art to create passive half-life improvement methods focus on increasing the apparent hydrodynamic radius of a drug. The kidney's glomerular filtration apparatus is the primary site in the body where blood components are filtered, see for reference e.g., Osicka et al. Clin Sci 1997 93:65 and Myers et al. Kidney Int 1982 21:633. The main determinant of filtration is the hydrodynamic radius of the molecule in the blood; smaller molecules (<80 kDa) are filtered out of the blood to a higher extent than larger molecules. Researchers have used this generalized rule to modify drugs to exhibit a larger hydrodynamic radius and thus longer half-life, mainly via chemical conjugation to large molecular weight water-soluble polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). Numerous PEGylated protein and small molecule therapeutics are currently offered in the clinic (Pasut and Veronese, 2009 Adv Drug Deliv Rev 61(13):1177; Fishburn, 2008 J Pharm Sci 97(10):4167). Though effective in many cases in increasing circulation half-life, especially as the hydrodynamic radius of the graft or fusion increases (Gao, Liu, et al., 2009 PNAS 106(36):15231), these methods offer challenges in manufacturing and maintenance of biological effector function. Heterogeneities in conjugation reactions can cause complex product mixtures with varying biological activities, due mostly to the utilization of site-unspecific chemistries. Extensive biochemical characterization often follows precise purification methods to retain a homogenous therapeutic product (Huang, Gough, et al, 2009 Anal Chem 81(2):567; Bailon, Palleroni, et al., 2001 Bioconj Chem 12(2):195; Dhalluin, Ross, et al., 2005 Bioconj Chem 16(3):504). Furthermore, attachment of large moieties, such as branched PEGs, to reactive zones of proteins can lead to decreased receptor affinity (Fishburn, 2008 J Pharm Sci 97(10):4167).",
            "Albumin may be used to bind a therapeutic protein for increased circulation of the drug (Dennis et al, 2002 J Bil Chem 277(38):35035; Walker, Dunlevy, et al., 2010 Prot Engr Des Sel 23(4):271) to increase the apparent size of the therapeutic by engineering it to bind another protein in the blood. In this manner, the drug attains its large molecular size only after administration into the blood stream. The addition of affinity-matured serum albumin-binding peptides to antibody fragments increased their circulation time 24 fold in mice (Dennis et al, 2002 J Bil Chem 277(38):35035). This method is complicated by the dynamics of albumin recycle by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and the use of cysteine-constrained cyclic peptides for functionality. Alternatively, recombinant addition of large antibody fragments may be made to a protein drug. This may cause structural as well as manufacturing complications, e.g., because of the use of complex cyclic or large domains for functionality. Despite high affinity for albumin, they require the physical constraint of correctly forming a cyclic structure prior to use. Methods of fusing larger antibody fragments may not be amendable to proteins with an already complex folding structure or low expression yield.",
            "The potential of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, antibody-coupled T-cell receptor (ACTR) therapies and other adoptive T-cell therapies in effecting complete and durable responses has been demonstrated in a number of malignant and infectious diseases. The development of more potent T cells is limited, however, by safety concerns, highlighted by the occurrence of on-target and off-target toxicities that, although uncommon, have been fatal on occasions. Timely pharmacological intervention can be effective in the management of adverse events but adoptively transferred T cells can persist long term, along with any unwanted effects. T cells targeting differentiation antigens can be expected to also recognize nonmalignant cells that express the same antigens, resulting in adverse events. For example, melanoma patients treated with T cells targeting melanocyte differentiation antigens, such as MART-1 and gp100, often develop vitiligo and uveitis. These on-target toxicities have been observed across all forms of therapeutic approaches, including tumor-infiltrating cells, in vitro-expanded T-cell clones and TCR-transgenic cells. In general, on-target autoimmunity is associated with tumor regression and is more prominent in treatment approaches that are more efficacious. On-target but off-tumour toxicities can be immediately life-threatening. For example, patients with colorectal cancer with lung and liver metastases may develop respiratory distress within 15 min of HER2-specific CAR T-cell infusion and may subsequently die from multiorgan failure 5 days later. As T-cell therapy becomes more effective, acute toxicities have also become more evident. Cytokine release syndrome, which is characterized by fevers, rigors, hypotension and hypoxia, has been observed in a number of CD19 CAR T-cell studies as a result of large-scale T-cell activation upon the recognition of CD19+ malignant cells.",

            "Genome engineering refers to strategies and techniques for the targeted, specific modification of the genetic information (genome) of living organisms. Genome engineering is an active field of research because of the wide range of possible applications, particularly in the area of human health, e.g., to correct a gene carrying a harmful mutation or to explore the function of a gene. Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion location of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disruption of normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unintended effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells. Common genome engineering strategies, such as ZFNs, TALENs, HEs, and MegaTALs, allow a specific area of the DNA to be modified, thereby increasing precision of the correction or insertion compared to earlier technologies. These platforms offer a greater degree of reproducibility, but limitations remain.",

Outbreaks occur repeatedly in west, central, and southern Africa and have caused several human epidemics in those areas since that time. The virus is passed to humans by two species of mosquito of the genus  and  . There are several Chikungunya genotypes: Indian Ocean, East/Central/South African (ECSA), Asian, West African, and Brazilian.",
            "Presently, CHIKV is a re-emerging human pathogen that has now established itself in Southeast Asia and has more recently spread to Europe. The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was introduced into Asia around 1958, and sites of endemic transmission within Southeastern Asia, including the Indian Ocean, were observed through 1996. The CHIKV epidemic moved throughout Asia, reaching Europe and Africa in the early 2000s, and was imported via travelers to North America and South America from 2005 to 2007. Sporadic outbreaks are still occurring in several countries, such as Italy, inflicting na\u00efve populations. Singapore, for instance, experienced two successive waves of Chikungunya virus outbreaks in January and August 2008. Of the two strain lineages of CHIKV, the African strain remains enzootic by cycling between mosquitoes and monkeys, but the Asian strain is transmitted directly between mosquitoes and humans. This cycle of transmission may have allowed the virus to become more pathogenic as the reservoir host was eliminated.",
            "In humans, CHIKV causes a debilitating disease characterized by fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, rash, muscle pain and joint pain. Following the acute phase of the illness, patients develop severe chronic symptoms lasting from several weeks to months, including fatigue, incapacitating joint pain and polyarthritis.",
            "The re-emergence of CHIKV has caused millions of cases throughout countries around the Indian Ocean and in Southeast Asia. Specifically, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar and Thailand have reported over 1.9 million cases since 2005. Globally, human CHIKV epidemics from 2004-2011 have resulted in 1.4-6.5 million reported cases, including a number of deaths. Thus, CHIKV remains a public threat that constitutes a major public health problem with severe social and economic impact.",
            "Despite significant morbidity and some cases of mortality associated with CHIKV infection and its growing prevalence and geographic distribution, there is currently no licensed CHIKV vaccine or antiviral approved for human use. Several potential CHIKV vaccine candidates have been tested in humans and animals with varying success.",

Dengue virus is a positive-sense RNA virus of the  genus of the Flaviviridae family, which also includes West Nile virus, Yellow Fever Virus, and Japanese Encephalitis virus. It is transmitted to humans through  (formerly  ) mosquito vectors and is mainly found in the tropical and semitropical areas of the world, where it is endemic in Asia, the Pacific region, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The incidence of infections has increased 30-fold over the last 50 years (WHO, Dengue:  (2009)) and Dengue virus is the second most common tropical infectious disease worldwide after malaria.",
            "There is no specific treatment for DENV infection, and control of DENV by vaccination has proved elusive, in part, because the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS is not completely understood. While infection with one serotype confers lifelong homotypic immunity, it confers only short term (approximately three to six months) cross protection against heterotypic serotypes. Also, there is evidence that prior infection with one type can produce an antibody response that can intensify, or enhance, the course of disease during a subsequent infection with a different serotype. The possibility that vaccine components could elicit enhancing antibody responses, as opposed to protective responses, has been a major concern in designing and testing vaccines to protect against dengue infections.",
            "In late 2015 and early 2016, the first dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV) by Sanofi Pasteur, was registered in several countries for use in individuals 9-45 years of age living in endemic areas. Issues with the vaccine include (1) weak protection against DENV1 and DENV2 (<60% efficacy); (2) relative risk of dengue hospitalization among children <9 years old (7.5\u00d7 higher than placebo); (3) immunogenicity not sustained after 1-2 years (implying the need for a 4 dose booster); and (4) lowest efficacy against DENV2, which often causes more severe conditions. This latter point is a major weakness with the Dengvaxia vaccine, signaling the need of a new, more effective vaccine effective against DENV2. Other tetravalent live-attenuated vaccines are under development in phase II and phase III clinical trials, and other vaccine candidates (based on subunit, DNA and purified inactivated virus platforms) are at earlier stages of clinical development, although the ability of these vaccine candidates to provide broad serotype protection has not been demonstrated.",

It is related to dengue, yellow fever, West Nile and Japanese encephalitis, viruses that are also members of the virus family Flaviviridae. ZIKV is spread to people through mosquito bites. The most common symptoms of ZIKV disease (Zika) are fever, rash, joint pain, and red eye. The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week. There is no vaccine to prevent, or medicine to treat, Zika virus.",

There are currently eight species in this genus, which have been identified and classified for different mammals, including humans, monkeys, and rodents. The most studied genus is human cytomegalovirus, also known as human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), which is widely distributed in the human population. Diseases associated with HHV-5 include mononucleosis and pneumonias. All herpesviruses share a characteristic ability to remain latent within the body over long periods of time. Although they may be found throughout the body, CMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands in humans and other mammals. Other CMV viruses are found in several mammal species, but species isolated from animals differ from HCMV in terms of genomic structure, and have not been reported to cause human disease.",
            "HCMV is endemic in most parts of the world. It is a ubiquitous large enveloped virus that infects 50 to 100% of the adult population worldwide. Although generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent hosts, HCMV infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised persons, such as infants following congenital or neonatal infections, transplant recipients, or AIDS patients.",
            "Primary infection normally results in subclinical disease after which the virus becomes latent, retaining the capacity to reactivate at a later time. The virus is transmitted through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk. In particular, individuals with undeveloped or compromised immunity are highly sensitive to infection by HCMV. It is estimated that at least 60% of the US population has been exposed to CMV, with a prevalence of more than 90% in high-risk groups (e.g., unborn babies whose mothers become infected with CMV during the pregnancy or people with HIV).",
            "In healthy individuals, HCMV typically causes an asymptomatic infection or produces mild, flulike symptoms. However, among two populations, HCMV is responsible for serious medical conditions. First, HCMV is a major cause of congenital defects in newborns infected in utero. Among congenitally infected newborns, 5-10% have major clinical symptoms at birth, such as microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, and hepatitis, as well as cytomegalic inclusion disease, which affects many tissues and organs including the central nervous system, liver, and retina and can lead to multi-organ failure and death. Other infants may be asymptomatic at birth, but later develop hearing loss or central nervous system abnormalities causing, in particular, poor intellectual performance and mental retardation. These pathologies are due in part to the ability of HCMV to enter and replicate in diverse cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, neurons, and monocytes/macrophages.",
            "The second population at risk are immunocompromised patients, such as those suffering from HIV infection and those undergoing transplantations. In this situation, the virus becomes an opportunistic pathogen and causes severe disease with high morbidity and mortality. The clinical disease causes a variety of symptoms including fever, pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, myelitis, colitis, uveitis, retinitis, and neuropathy. Rarer manifestations of HCMV infections in immunocompetent individuals include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, meningoencephalitis, pericarditis, myocarditis, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. Moreover. HCMV infection increases the risk of organ graft loss through transplant vascular sclerosis and restenosis, and may increase atherosclerosis in transplant patients as well as in the general population. It is estimated that HCMV infection causes clinical disease in 75% of patients in the first year after transplantation.",
            "There is currently no approved HCMV vaccine. Two candidate vaccines, Towne and gB/MF59, have completed phase II efficacy trials. The Towne vaccine appears protective against both infection and disease caused by challenge with pathogenic Toledo strain and also appears to be effective in preventing severe post-transplantation CMV disease. However, in a small phase II clinical trial, a low dose of Towne vaccine failed to show protection against infection of scronegative mothers who had children actively shedding CMV.",
            "The gB/MF59 vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine comprised of a transmembrane-deleted version of HCMV gB protein, which induces high levels of fibroblast entry neutralizing antibodies in humans and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in both adults and toddlers. A recent phase II double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the gB/MF59 vaccine revealed a 50% efficacy in inducing sterilizing immunity. As this vaccine induces potent antibody responses but very weak T-cell responses, the partial efficacy provided by the vaccine is thought to be primarily antibody-mediated. While this HCMV vaccine is the first to show any protective efficacy, its 50% protection falls short of the 80-90% desired for most vaccines.",
            "In addition, antibody therapy has been used to control HCMV infection in immunocompromised individuals and to reduce the pathological consequences of maternal-fetal transmission, although such therapy is usually not sufficient to eradicate the virus. HCMV immunoglobulins (Igs) have been administered to transplant patients in association with immunosuppressive treatments for prophylaxis of HCMV disease with mixed results. Antibody therapy has also been used to control congenital infection and prevent disease in newborns. However, these products are plasma derivatives with relatively low potency and have to be administered by intravenous infusion at very high doses in order to deliver sufficient amounts of neutralizing antibodies.",
            "HCMV is the leading viral cause of neurodevelopmental abnormality and other birth defects in children and the costs to society are substantial. Although antiviral therapy is available, the treatment with antiviral agents is imperfect and development of a CMV vaccine is the most promising strategy for preventing CMV infection. Given that the health and economic benefits of effective HCMV vaccines are significant, the US Institute of Medicine and US National Vaccine Program Office has categorized development of a CMV vaccine as a highest priority, but no candidate vaccine is under consideration for licensure."

Through targeted delivery of potent cytotoxins, protein drug conjugates exhibit improved therapeutic index over traditional chemotherapies with enhanced efficacy relative to standard monoclonal antibody therapies. However, current methods utilize nonspecific modes of conjugation of drugs to proteins, thereby leading to heterogeneous drug products with varied numbers of drugs conjugated across a number of possible sites. Technical challenges associated with drug conjugation to proteins using naturally occurring amino acids, are primarily due to heterogeneous degrees and location of drug loading as well as conjugate instability.",

Site-specific ADCs have comparable potency to randomly conjugated ADCs while exhibiting superior therapeutic index and pharmacokinetics. However, limitations exist in thiol-based coupling stability due to plasma hydrolysis of the succinimde ring of the thiomaleimide conjugate, resulting in drug transfer to serum albumin. Furthermore, the partial reduction and reformation of disulfide bonds that facilitates conjugation to the engineered free cysteine, can lead to aberrant disulfide-mediated quaternary structure. An alternative to using introduced free cysteine residues is to use site-specific incorporation of non-natural amino acids with chemical side chains that are compatible with bio-orthogonal conjugation chemistry.",
            "The essential componentry of any non-natural amino acid (nnAA) incorporation system consists of an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (aaRS) that charges a specific tRNA with a nnAA. The aaRS-tRNA pair must be orthogonal with respect to the host cell or expression system in which they are employed. That is, the nnAA-specific synthetase must not recognize any host tRNAs or cognate amino acids, and the tRNA must not be aminoacylated by any host aaRS. Additionally, the orthogonal tRNA anticodon is often mutated to recognize a stop or nonsense codon. Repurposing of non-proteinogenic codons, such as the amber stop codon TAG, enables incorporation of a nnAA at any site in a protein through mutagenesis of the mRNA coding sequence to TAG. Amber suppression is the most widely used mode of co-translational, enzyme catalyzed nnAA incorporation. Non-natural amino acids with bio-orthogonal reactive chemical side chains can be used as a chemical \u201chandle\u201d to conjugate various payloads to discrete sites in a protein. This approach can generate additional functionality to proteins by direct conjugation of biologically active adduct, such as fluorescent or radioactive labels, photoactivatable markers, pharmacokinetic modifying PEGs, or chemotherapeutic agents. Unfortunately, the current methods for nnAA incorporation and conjugation of bio-orthogonal reactive chemical side chains into proteins are hindered by low overall product yield, nnAA incorporation inefficiency and low conjugation efficiency.",

        "paragraph": [
            "Citrullinemia is an autosomal recessive urea cycle disorder that causes abnormal buildup of ammonia and other toxic substances in the blood. Citrullinemia Type 2 (\u201cCTLN2\u201d) is a form of Citrullinemia that is caused by mutation of the Solute Carrier Family 25, Member 13 gene (\u201cSLC25A13\u201d). CTLN2 is also known as Adult-Onset Citrullinemia Type 2 or Citrin Deficiency. CTLN2 causes nocturnal delirium, aggression, irritability, hyperactivity, delusions, disorientation, restlessness, drowsiness, loss of memory, flapping tremor, convulsive seizures, coma, or even death resulting from brain edema. Kobayashi, K. et al., GeneReviews (2008); http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1181/. CTLN2 is found in the Japanese population with an estimated incidence of 1 in 100,000 to 230,000. Additionally, CTLN2 has been reported in East Asian and Middle Eastern populations. Current treatments for CTLN2 attempt to control signs and symptoms by having individuals consume diets that are low in carbohydrates and high in proteins and fats. Also, treatment with arginine, sodium benzoate, or sodium phenylacetate removes ammonia from the blood. In serious cases, liver transplantation has been successful in treating CTLN2 and dialysis can be used to remove ammonia from the blood. Saheki, T. et al., Molec. Genet. Metab. 100(Suppl. 1):S59-S64 (2010). Thus, most effective treatment for this disorder is liver transplantation, although many patients can be managed by a low-carbohydrate/high-protein diet. However, none of these treatments completely control the disorder.",
            "The principal gene associated with CTLN2 is SLC25A13, which has two variants (Genbank Accession Nos. NM_001160210, NP_001153682; NM_014251, NP_055066; XM_006715831, XP_006715894; XM_011515727, XP_011514029). SLC25A13 encodes Citrin, which is a calcium-dependent mitochondrial solute carrier protein. Citrin is also known as Mitochondrial Aspartate Glutamate Carrier 2 or ARALAR2. Citrin plays a critical role in the urea cycle by catalyzing the mitochondrial uptake of glutamate and export of aspartate. Saheki, T. et al., Metab. Brain Dis. 17:335-346 (2002). Depending on the variant, the precursor form of human Citrin is either 676 or 675 amino acids, while its mature form is either 675 or 674 amino acids with the initiator methionine cleaved off.",
            "A complete or partial loss of Citrin function leads to abnormal buildup of ammonia and other toxic substances in the blood. For example, loss of Citrin has been reported to lead to ammonia levels greater than 750 \u03bcg/dL, as compared to 49 \u03bcg/dL or less in normal individuals. Aside from liver transplant, treatment for CTLN2 generally focuses on managing the disease, e.g., through diet and nutritional support. There are currently no available therapeutics to treat CTLN2. Accordingly, there is a need for improved therapy to treat CTLN2."

The therapeutic applications of translatable nucleotide delivery are extremely broad as constructs can be synthesized to produce any chosen protein sequence, whether or not indigenous to the system.

Genome engineering is an active field of research because of the wide range of possible applications, particularly in the area of human health, e.g., to correct a gene carrying a harmful mutation or to explore the function of a gene. Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion location of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disruption of normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unintended effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells. Common genome engineering strategies, such as ZFNs, TALENs, HEs, and MegaTALs, allow a specific area of the DNA to be modified, thereby increasing precision of the correction or insertion compared to earlier technologies. These platforms offer a greater degree of reproducibility, but limitations remain.",

            "Gene editing using site-specific nucleases has emerged as a technology for both basic biomedical research and therapeutic development. Various platforms based on four major types of endonucleases have been developed for gene editing, namely meganucleases and their derivatives, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) associated endonuclease 9 (cas9). Each of nuclease type is capable of inducing a DNA double-stranded break (DSB) at specific DNA loci, thus triggering two DNA repair pathways. The non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway generates random insertion/deletion (indel) mutations at the DSB, whereas the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway repairs the DSB with the genetic information carried on a donor template. Therefore, these gene editing platforms are useful for manipulating genes at specific genomic loci in multiple ways, such as disrupting gene function, repairing a mutant gene to a wild type, and inserting new DNA sequences.",
            "Although these genome-editing techniques have been developed for producing targeted genome modifications, there remains a need for new genome gene editing platforms that are capable of manipulating genes at specific genomic loci in multiple ways, such as disrupting gene function, repairing a mutant gene to produce a wild type product, and/or inserting heterologous DNA material at specific loci within the genome of a target cell, for example, for use in the treatment of diseases, such as monogenic diseases (e.g., hemophilia A).",
            "Hemophilia A (HemA) is caused by a genetic defect in the Factor VIII (FVIII) gene that results in low or undetectable levels of FVIII protein in the blood. This results in ineffective clot formation at sites of tissue injury leading to uncontrolled bleeding that can be fatal if not treated. Replacement of the missing FVIII protein is the current standard of care. However, protein replacement therapy requires frequent intravenous injection or infusion of FVIII protein, which is inconvenient in adults, problematic in children, cost prohibitive (>$200,000/year), and can result in breakthrough bleeding events if the treatment regimen is not closely followed.",
            "The FVIII gene (also referred to as F8) is expressed primarily in sinusoidal endothelial cells that are present in the liver as well as other sites in the body. Gene delivery methods have been developed that target the hepatocytes and these methods have been used to deliver a FVIII gene as a treatment for HemA both in animal models and in patients in clinical trials.",
            "Despite progress with gene therapy, which is exclusively virus-based using Adeno Associated Virus (AAV), the methods have a number of disadvantages. For example, reported AAV-based gene therapy uses a FVIII gene driven by a liver specific promoter that is encapsulated inside an AAV virus capsid (for example, using the serotypes AAV5, AAV8, AAV3b or AAV9 or AAVhu37). In general, AAV viruses used for gene therapy deliver the packaged gene cassette into the nucleus of the transduced cells where the gene cassette remains almost exclusively extra-chromosomal and it is the extra-chromosomal copies of the therapeutic gene that give rise to the therapeutic protein. AAV does not have a mechanism to integrate the encapsulated DNA into the genome of the host cells. Instead because the therapeutic gene is maintained largely as an extra-chromosomal episome, the therapeutic gene is not replicated when the host cell divides. Furthermore, the therapeutic DNA can be subject to degradation over time. It has been demonstrated that when liver cells containing AAV episomes are induced to divide, the AAV genome is not replicated but is instead diluted (Grimm et al. 206, J Virol 80, 426-439; Colella et al. 2018, Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev 8, 87-104). As a result, AAV based gene therapy is not expected to be effective when used to treat children whose livers have not yet achieved adult size. In addition, it is currently unknown how long an AAV based gene therapy will persist when given to adult humans. Therefore, there is a critical need for developing new effective and permeant treatments for HemA."

Infection was associated with a mild, self-limiting febrile illness characterized by headache, rash, conjunctivitis, myalgia, and arthralgia. Since 2010, and especially in the context of its spread and dissemination to countries of the Western Hemisphere, more severe clinical consequences have been observed. Infection of fetuses in utero during pregnancy, particularly during the first and second trimesters, has been associated with placental insufficiency and congenital malformations including cerebral calcifications, microcephaly, and miscarriage. In adults, ZIKV infection is linked to an increased incidence of Guillain-Barr6 syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disease characterized by paralysis and polyneuropathy. In addition to mosquito and in utero transmission, sexual transmission of ZIKV has been described from men-to-women, men-to-men, and women-to-men. Persistent ZIKV infection can occur, as viral RNA has been detected in semen, sperm, and vaginal secretions up to 6 months following infection. Thus, ZIKV is now a global disease with locally-acquired and travel-associated transmission through multiple routes in the Americas. Africa, and Asia.

        "paragraph": [
            "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a genus of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae, in the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae. There are currently eight species in this genus, which have been identified and classified for different mammals, including humans, monkeys, and rodents. The most studied genus is human cytomegalovirus, also known as human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), which is widely distributed in the human population. Diseases associated with HHV-5 include mononucleosis and pneumonias. All herpesviruses share a characteristic ability to remain latent within the body over long periods of time. Although they may be found throughout the body, CMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands in humans and other mammals. Other CMV viruses are found in several mammal species, but species isolated from animals differ from HCMV in terms of genomic structure, and have not been reported to cause human disease.",
            "HCMV is endemic in most parts of the world. It is a ubiquitous large enveloped virus that infects 50 to 100% of the adult population worldwide. Although generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent hosts, HCMV infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised persons, such as infants following congenital or neonatal infections, transplant recipients, or AIDS patients.",
            "Primary infection normally results in subclinical disease after which the virus becomes latent, retaining the capacity to reactivate at a later time. The virus is transmitted through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk. In particular, individuals with undeveloped or compromised immunity are highly sensitive to infection by HCMV. It is estimated that at least 60% of the US population has been exposed to CMV, with a prevalence of more than 90% in high-risk groups (e.g., unborn babies whose mothers become infected with CMV during the pregnancy or people with HIV).",
            "In healthy individuals, HCMV typically causes an asymptomatic infection or produces mild, flulike symptoms. However, among two populations, HCMV is responsible for serious medical conditions. First, HCMV is a major cause of congenital defects in newborns infected in utero. Among congenitally infected newborns, 5-10% have major clinical symptoms at birth, such as microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, and hepatitis, as well as cytomegalic inclusion disease, which affects many tissues and organs including the central nervous system, liver, and retina and can lead to multi-organ failure and death. Other infants may be asymptomatic at birth, but later develop hearing loss or central nervous system abnormalities causing, in particular, poor intellectual performance and mental retardation. These pathologies are due in part to the ability of HCMV to enter and replicate in diverse cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, neurons, and monocytes/macrophages.",
            "The second population at risk are immunocompromised patients, such as those suffering from HIV infection and those undergoing transplantations. In this situation, the virus becomes an opportunistic pathogen and causes severe disease with high morbidity and mortality. The clinical disease causes a variety of symptoms including fever, pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, myelitis, colitis, uveitis, retinitis, and neuropathy. Rarer manifestations of HCMV infections in immunocompetent individuals include Guillain-Barre syndrome, meningoencephalitis, pericarditis, myocarditis, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. Moreover, HCMV infection increases the risk of organ graft loss through transplant vascular sclerosis and restenosis, and may increase atherosclerosis in transplant patients as well as in the general population. It is estimated that HCMV infection causes clinical disease in 75% of patients in the first year after transplantation.",
            "There is currently no approved HCMV vaccine. Two candidate vaccines, Towne and gB/MF59, have completed phase II efficacy trials. The Towne vaccine appears protective against both infection and disease caused by challenge with pathogenic Toledo strain and also appears to be effective in preventing severe post-transplantation CMV disease. However, in a small phase II clinical trial, a low dose of Towne vaccine failed to show protection against infection of seronegative mothers who had children actively shedding CMV.",
            "The gB/MF59 vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine comprised of a transmembrane-deleted version of HCMV gB protein, which induces high levels of fibroblast entry neutralizing antibodies in humans and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in both adults and toddlers. A recent phase II double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the gB/MF59 vaccine revealed a 50% efficacy in inducing sterilizing immunity. As this vaccine induces potent antibody responses but very weak T-cell responses, the partial efficacy provided by the vaccine is thought to be primarily antibody-mediated. While this HCMV vaccine is the first to show any protective efficacy, its 50% protection falls short of the 80-90% desired for most vaccines.",
            "In addition, antibody therapy has been used to control HCMV infection in immunocompromised individuals and to reduce the pathological consequences of maternal-fetal transmission, although such therapy is usually not sufficient to eradicate the virus. HCMV immunoglobulins (Igs) have been administered to transplant patients in association with immunosuppressive treatments for prophylaxis of HCMV disease with mixed results. Antibody therapy has also been used to control brief infection and prevent disease in newborns. However, these products are plasma derivatives with relatively low potency and have to be administered by intravenous infusion at very high doses in order to deliver sufficient amounts of neutralizing antibodies.",
            "HCMV is the leading viral cause of neurodevelopmental abnormality and other birth defects in children and the costs to society are substantial. Although antiviral therapy is available, the treatment with antiviral agents is imperfect and development of a CMV vaccine is the most promising strategy for preventing CMV infection. Given that the health and economic benefits of effective HCMV vaccines are significant, the US Institute of Medicine and US National Vaccine Program Office has categorized development of a CMV vaccine as a highest priority, but no candidate vaccine is under consideration for licensure."

            "There are multiple problems with prior methodologies of delivering pharmaceutical compositions in order to achieve effective protein expression both for therapeutics and bioprocessing applications. For example, introduced DNA can integrate into host cell genomic DNA at some frequency, resulting in alterations and/or damage to the host cell genomic DNA. Alternatively, the heterologous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) introduced into a cell can be inherited by daughter cells (whether or not the heterologous DNA has integrated into the chromosome) or by offspring.",
            "In addition, there are multiple steps which must occur after delivery but before the encoded protein is made which can effect protein expression. Once inside the cell, DNA must be transported into the nucleus where it is transcribed into RNA. The RNA transcribed from DNA must then enter the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. Not only do the multiple processing steps from administered DNA to protein create lag times before the generation of the functional protein, each step represents an opportunity for error and damage to the cell. Further, it is known to be difficult to obtain DNA expression in cells as frequently DNA enters a cell but is not expressed or not expressed at reasonable rates or concentrations. This can be a particular problem when DNA is introduced into primary cells or modified cell lines.",

For example, influenza infections are the seventh leading cause of death in the United States with 200,000 hospitalizations and 40,000 deaths seen in the United States per year and cause about 3-5 million hospitalizations and about 300,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide per year. Millions of people receive flu vaccines to protect them from seasonal flu each year. Vaccination can also rapidly prevent the spread of an emerging influenze pandemic.",
            "A typical vaccine contains an agent that resembles a weakened or dead form of the disease-causing agent, which could be a microorganism, such as bacteria, virus, fungi, parasites, or one or more toxins and/or one or more proteins, for example, surface proteins, (i.e., antigens) of such a microorganism. The antigen or agent in the vaccine can stimulate the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a foreign invader, generate antibodies against it, destroy it and develop a memory of it. The vaccine-induced memory enables the immune system to act quickly to protect the body from any of these agents that it later encounters.",
            "Vaccine production used in the art e.g., antigen vaccine production, has several stages, including the generation of antigens, antigen purification and inactivation, and vaccine formulation. First, the antigen is generated through culturing viruses in cell lines, growing bacteria in bioreactors, or producing recombinant proteins derived from viruses and bacteria in cell cultures, yeast or bacteria. Recombinant proteins are then purified and the viruses and bacteria are inactivated before they are formulated with adjuvants in vaccines. It has been a challenge to drastically reduce the time and expense associated with current technologies in vaccine development.",
            "Another obstacle to the development of new vaccine is the constant evolution of most infectious agents, such as viruses and bacteria. Viruses often mutate their surface proteins to generate new antigens which can help them skipping the active immune system that has been immunized by vaccines containing the viruses. In contrast, bacteria acquire and mutate key proteins to evade host defense and effective antibiotic applications.",

Hemagglutinin (HA), the major envelop glycoprotein of influenza A and B viruses, or its homologue, hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) in influenza C virus, is the natural reservoir of the viruses. The rapid evolution of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the influenza virus results in the constant emergence of new strains, rendering the adaptive immune response of the host only partially protective to new infections. The biggest challenge for therapy and prophylaxis against influenza and other infections using traditional vaccines is the limitation of vaccines in breadth, providing protection only against closely related subtypes. In addition, today's length of the production process inhibits any fast reaction to develop and produce an adapted vaccine in a pandemic situation.",

Through targeted delivery of potent cytotoxins, protein drug conjugates exhibit improved therapeutic index over traditional chemotherapies with enhanced efficacy relative to standard monoclonal antibody therapies. However, current methods utilize nonspecific modes of conjugation of drugs to proteins, thereby leading to heterogeneous drug products with varied numbers of drugs conjugated across a number of possible sites. Technical challenges associated with drug conjugation to proteins using naturally occurring amino acids, are primarily due to heterogeneous degrees and location of drug loading as well as conjugate instability.",

Site-specific ADCs have comparable potency to randomly conjugated ADCs while exhibiting superior therapeutic index and pharmacokinetics. However, limitations exist in thiol-based coupling stability due to plasma hydrolysis of the succinimde ring of the thiomaleimide conjugate, resulting in drug transfer to serum albumin. Furthermore, the partial reduction and reformation of disulfide bonds that facilitates conjugation to the engineered free cysteine, can lead to aberrant disulfide-mediated quaternary structure. An alternative to using introduced free cysteine residues is to use site-specific incorporation of non-natural amino acids with chemical side chains that are compatible with bio-orthogonal conjugation chemistry.",
            "The essential componentry of any non-natural amino acid (nnAA) incorporation system consists of an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (aaRS) that charges a specific tRNA with a nnAA. The aaRS-tRNA pair must be orthogonal with respect to the host cell or expression system in which they are employed. That is, the nnAA-specific synthetase must not recognize any host tRNAs or cognate amino acids, and the tRNA must not be aminoacylated by any host aaRS. Additionally, the orthogonal tRNA anticodon is often mutated to recognize a stop or nonsense codon. Repurposing of non-proteinogenic codons, such as the amber stop codon TAG, enables incorporation of a nnAA at any site in a protein through mutagenesis of the mRNA coding sequence to TAG. Amber suppression is the most widely used mode of co-translational, enzyme catalyzed nnAA incorporation. Non-natural amino acids with bio-orthogonal reactive chemical side chains can be used as a chemical \u201chandle\u201d to conjugate various payloads to discrete sites in a protein. This approach can generate additional functionality to proteins by direct conjugation of biologically active adduct, such as fluorescent or radioactive labels, photoactivatable markers, pharmacokinetic modifying PEGs, or chemotherapeutic agents. Unfortunately, the current methods for nnAA incorporation and conjugation of bio-orthogonal reactive chemical side chains into proteins are hindered by low overall product yield, nnAA incorporation inefficiency and low conjugation efficiency.",

While inhibition of VEGF-A pathways via both small molecules and antibodies has become the standard of care in selected forms of cancer and macular degeneration, it has remained challenging to unlock the potential of augmenting VEGF-A pathways for potential therapeutic effects that include relaxing smooth muscle, promoting new vessel formation, and potentially reversing the defects in vascular response associated with diabetic vascular complications.",
            "As such, a diverse number of methods have been attempted to allow clinically tractable approaches to control the spatial and temporal expression of VEGF-A in target tissues. However, each of the approaches has significant drawbacks: systemic VEGF-A protein approaches can result in significant hypotension and VEGF-A is rapidly degraded; viral encapsulated and naked VEGF-A DNA plasmids have limited temporal control of protein expression and the efficiency of in vivo expression can be highly variable and non-dose dependent; adenoviral vectors can activate the immune system; and naked RNA is labile, has low levels of transfection, and also can trigger immune activation. As a result, these limitations have restricted the applicability of VEGF-A as a therapeutic platform.",
            "In some previous studies, the in vivo use of therapeutic RNAs, e.g., siRNAs, has been dependent on utilizing lipid-nanoparticles (LNPs) to protect the mRNA from degradation as well as for efficient transfection. Furthermore, attempts to reach therapeutic levels of RNAi therapy in organs other than liver have resulted in infusion related hypersensitivity reactions as well as hepatotoxicity, thus limiting their use for disease therapy in other organ systems (Rudin C. M. et al., Clin. Cancer Res., (2004) 10, 7244-7251). In addition, other variants of these LNPs have been used clinically for therapeutic uses in selected cases, but can cause dose-dependent tissue injury (Coelho T. et al., N Engl J Med, (2013) 369, 819-829). Examples of such dose-dependent toxicity effects of some lipid-based nucleic acid pharmaceutical formulations include infusion related reactions such as dyspnea, hypoxia, rigors, back pain, hypotension, and liver injury. Furthermore, while cationic lipids are typically included in lipid formulations of RNA therapeutics, e.g., siRNA, to improve RNA encapsulation and stability, some such lipids may exhibit dose dependent toxicities, such as disruption of the integrity of a membrane structure, cell lysis and necrosis, and/or alteration of the expression of multiple genes in undesirable manner (Xue H. Y., Curr Pharm Des., (2015) 21(22):3140-7). At preclinical and clinical levels, dose dependent systemic toxicities of lipoplexes have also been well-documented. Capture of lipoplexes by Kupffer cells in liver can trigger inflammatory responses, which may inflict damages to liver and result in elevated levels in major liver function indicators. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia may also occur (Zhang J., Adv Drug Deliv Rev., (2005) 57(5):689-698). Moreover, lipofectamine causes an immune/inflammatory response and cell death.",

Generally, vaccination is one of the pivotal achievements of modern medicine. However, effective vaccines are currently available only for a limited number of diseases. Accordingly, infections that are not preventable by vaccination still affect millions of people every year.",
            "Commonly, vaccines may be subdivided into \u201cfirst\u201d, \u201csecond\u201d and \u201cthird\u201d generation vaccines. \u201cFirst generation\u201d vaccines are, typically, whole-organism vaccines. They are based on either live and attenuated or killed pathogens, e.g. viruses, bacteria or the like. The major drawback of live and attenuated vaccines is the risk for a reversion to life-threatening variants. Thus, although attenuated, such pathogens may still intrinsically bear unpredictable risks. Killed pathogens may not be as effective as desired for generating a specific immune response. In order to minimize these risks, \u201csecond generation\u201d vaccines were developed. These are, typically, subunit vaccines, consisting of defined antigens or recombinant protein components which are derived from pathogens.",

They are typically composed of genetically engineered nucleic acid molecules which allow expression of peptide or protein (antigen) fragments characteristic for a pathogen or a tumor antigen in vivo. Genetic vaccines are expressed upon administration to a patient after uptake by target cells. Expression of the administered nucleic acids results in production of the encoded proteins. In the event these proteins are recognized as foreign by the patient's immune system, an immune response is triggered.",
            "DNA as well as RNA may be used as nucleic acid molecules for administration in the context of genetic vaccination. DNA is known to be relatively stable and easy to handle. However, the use of DNA bears the risk of undesired insertion of the administered DNA-fragments into the patient's genome potentially resulting mutagenic events such as in loss of function of the impaired genes. As a further risk, the undesired generation of anti-DNA antibodies has emerged. Another drawback is the limited expression level of the encoded peptide or protein that is achievable upon DNA administration because the DNA must enter the nucleus in order to be transcribed before the resulting mRNA can be translated. Among other reasons, the expression level of the administered DNA will be dependent on the presence of specific transcription factors which regulate DNA transcription. In the absence of such factors, DNA transcription will not yield satisfying amounts of RNA. As a result, the level of translated peptide or protein obtained is limited.",
            "By using RNA instead of DNA for genetic vaccination, the risk of undesired genomic integration and generation of anti-DNA antibodies is minimized or avoided. However, RNA is considered to be a rather unstable molecular species which may readily be degraded by ubiquitous RNAses.",
            "mRNA vaccines comprising antigen-encoding mRNA complexed to protamine are already described in the prior art (e.g. Petsch et al., Nat Biotechnol. 2012 December; 30(12):1210-6., Schnee et al., PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2016 Jun. 23; 10(6):e0004746., EP1083232, WO2010/037539, WO2012/116811, WO2012/116810, and WO2015/024665). Also WO2016/176330 describes lipid nanoparticle compositions comprising nucleoside-modified RNA encoding different antigens.",
            "Even if a lot of progress was made in the last years there is still a need in the art for providing an efficient method for mRNA vaccination, which allows eliciting an adaptive immune response, wherein the administration is not severely impaired by early degradation of the antigen or by an inefficient translation of the mRNA due to inefficient release of the mRNA in the cell. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to decrease the dose of mRNA vaccines to decrease potential safety concerns and to make the vaccines affordable for the third world.",
            "There are many challenges associated with the delivery of nucleic acids to effect a desired response in a biological system. Nucleic acid based therapeutics, such as vaccines, have enormous potential but there remains a need for more effective delivery of nucleic acids to appropriate sites within a cell or organism in order to realize this potential.",
            "However, two problems currently face the use of oligonucleotides in therapeutic contexts. First, free RNAs are susceptible to nuclease digestion in plasma.

Lipid nanoparticles formed from cationic lipids with other lipid components, such as neutral lipids, cholesterol, PEG, PEGylated lipids, and oligonucleotides have been used to block degradation of the RNAs in plasma and facilitate the cellular uptake of the oligonucleotides.",

Three types of CRISPR-Cas systems (type I, type II and IIb, and type III) have previously been described, and a fourth was more recently identified (type V). Most uses of CRISPR-Cas for genome editing have been with the type II system. The main advantage provided by the bacterial type II CRISPR-Cas system lies in the minimal requirement for programmable DNA interference: an endonuclease, Cas9, guided by a customizable dual-RNA structure. As initially demonstrated in the original type II system of  , trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA) binds to the invariable repeats of precursor CRISPR RNA (pre-crRNA) forming a dual-RNA that is essential for both RNA co-maturation by RNase III in the presence of Cas9, and invading DNA cleavage by Cas9. As demonstrated in  , Cas9 guided by the duplex formed between mature activating tracr RNA and targeting crRNA introduces site-specific double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks in the invading cognate DNA. Cas9 is a multi-domain enzyme that uses an HNH nuclease domain to cleave the target strand (defined as complementary to the spacer sequence of crRNA) and a RuvC-like domain to cleave the non-target strand, enabling the conversion of the dsDNA cleaving Cas9 into a nickase by selective motif inactivation. DNA cleavage specificity is determined by two parameters: the variable, spacer-derived sequence of crRNA targeting the protospacer sequence (a protospacer is defined as the sequence on the DNA target that is non-complementary to the spacer of crRNA) and a short sequence, the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM), located immediately 3\u2032 (downstream) of the protospacer on the non-target DNA strand.",

The system is versatile, enabling multiplex genome engineering by programming Cas9 to edit several sites in a genome simultaneously by using multiple guide RNAs. The conversion of Cas9 into a nickase was shown to facilitate homology-directed repair in mammalian genomes with reduced mutagenic activity. In addition, the DNA-binding activity of a Cas9 catalytic inactive mutant has, for example, been exploited to engineer RNA-programmable transcriptional silencing and activating devices or epigenetic modifiers.",

            "Editing genomes using the RNA-guided DNA targeting principle of CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-CRISPR associated proteins) immunity has been exploited widely over the past few months (1-13). The main advantage provided by the bacterial type II CRISPR-Cas system lies in the minimal requirement for programmable DNA interference: an endonuclease, Cas9, guided by a customizable dual-RNA structure (14). As initially demonstrated in the original type II system of  , trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA) (15,16) binds to the invariable repeats of precursor CRISPR RNA (pre-crRNA) forming a dual-RNA (14-17) that is essential for both RNA co-maturation by RNase III in the presence of Cas9 (15-17), and invading DNA cleavage by Cas9 (14,15,17-19). As demonstrated in  , Cas9 guided by the duplex formed between mature activating tracrRNA and targeting crRNA (14-16) introduces site-specific double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks in the invading cognate DNA (14,17-19). Cas9 is a multi-domain enzyme (14,20,21) that uses an HNH nuclease domain to cleave the target strand (defined as complementary to the spacer sequence of crRNA) and a RuvC-like domain to cleave the non-target strand (14,22,23), enabling the conversion of the dsDNA cleaving Cas9 into a nickase by selective motif inactivation (2,8,14,24,25). DNA cleavage specificity is determined by two parameters: the variable, spacer-derived sequence of crRNA targeting the protospacer sequence (a protospacer is defined as the sequence on the DNA target that is complementary to the spacer of crRNA) and a short sequence, the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM), located immediately downstream of the protospacer on the non-target DNA strand (14,18,23,26-28).",
            "Recent studies have demonstrated that RNA-guided Cas9 can be employed as an efficient genome editing tool in human cells (1,2,8,11), mice (9,10), zebrafish (6),  (5), worms (4), plants (12,13), yeast (3) and bacteria (7). The system is versatile, enabling multiplex genome engineering by programming Cas9 to edit several sites in a genome simultaneously by simply using multiple guide RNAs (2,7,8,10). The easy conversion of Cas9 into a nickase was shown to facilitate homology-directed repair in mammalian genomes with reduced mutagenic activity (2,8,24,25). In addition, the DNA-binding activity of a Cas9 catalytic inactive mutant has been exploited to engineer RNA-programmable transcriptional silencing and activating devices (29,30).",

For example, a peptide that is potentially useful as a therapeutic agent may be quickly degraded or otherwise inactivated upon administration to a patient as a result of proteases present within the patient. Likewise, infectious agents such as bacteria or viruses are more likely to develop resistance against peptides that contain only naturally occurring amino acids. This occurs because enzymes that are produced by the bacteria or virus that can inactivate a peptide drug are more likely to inactivate a peptide containing naturally occurring amino acids as opposed to a peptide containing non-native amino acids. Such limitations become even more apparent when compared with small organic molecule synthesis, in which any structural change can be made to influence functional properties of the compound. As a result, proteins containing non-native amino acids are becoming more auspicious for therapeutic uses. Furthermore, peptides containing non-native amino acids are extremely useful for non-therapeutic research purposes, such as uses relevant to the structural and functional probing of proteins, construction of peptide libraries for combinatorial chemistry, and proteomic studies.",
            "Although the twenty naturally occurring amino acids can be modified by post-translational modification, expanding the genetic code to include additional non-native amino acids with novel biological, chemical, or physical properties will increase the utility of the protein containing such novel non-native amino acids. Protein properties may include the size, acidity, nucleophilicity, hydrogen-bonding, or hydrophobicity of the protein.",
            "Different strategies have been utilized to synthesize peptides containing non-native amino acids. Synthetic peptide chemistry has been used routinely for this purpose. See, e.g., Eckert et al., Cell 99:103-15 (1999). However, routine solid-phase peptide synthesis is generally limited to small peptides with less than 100 residues. With the recent development of enzymatic ligation and native chemical ligation of peptide fragments, it is possible to make larger proteins. However, these methods are not easily scaled. See, e.g., Dawson and Kent, Annu Rev. Biochem. 69:923 (2000).",
            "In vivo translation using living cells is widely used for the efficient synthesis and post-translational modification of proteins from a genetically encoded natural or recombinant DNA sequence. However, folding may be inefficient if the protein is expressed in inclusion bodies. Most importantly, such methods are more difficult for the selective incorporation of multiple non-native amino acids, or to control the post-translational modification process.",
            "In vitro, or cell-free, protein synthesis offers several advantages over conventional in vivo protein expression methods. Cell-free systems can direct most, if not all, of the metabolic resources of the cell towards the exclusive production of one protein. Moreover, the lack of a cell wall and membrane components in vitro is advantageous since it allows for control of the synthesis environment. For example, tRNA levels can be changed to reflect the codon usage of genes being expressed. The redox potential, pH, or ionic strength can also be altered with greater flexibility than with in vivo protein synthesis because concerns of cell growth or viability do not exist. Furthermore, direct recovery of purified, properly folded protein products can be easily achieved.",
            "The productivity of cell-free systems has improved over 2-orders of magnitude in recent years, from about 5 \u03bcg/ml-hr to about 500 \u03bcg/ml-hr. Such improvements have made in vitro protein synthesis a practical technique for laboratory-scale research and provides a platform technology for high-throughput protein expression. It further indicates the feasibility for using cell-free technologies as an alternative means to in vivo large-scale, commercial production of protein pharmaceuticals.",
            "The incorporation of non-native amino acids into proteins remains a challenge with both in vivo and in vitro protein synthesis systems. A major hurdle in this field of endeavor is promoting recognition of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase with a non-native amino acid. An aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is an enzyme that catalyzes the bond of a specific amino acid to its cognate tRNA molecule. In most cases, each naturally occurring amino acid has one specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that will aminoacylate that amino acid to its proper tRNA molecule, which is known as tRNA charging. There exists relatively few aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases considering the fact that the degeneracy of the genetic code allows amino acids to be charged to more than one kind of tRNA molecule. Thus, the success of incorporating non-native amino acids into proteins depends on the recognition of the non-native amino acid by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which in general requires high selectively to insure the fidelity of protein translation. The fidelity of aminoacylation is maintained both at the level of substrate discrimination and proofreading of both non-cognate intermediates and protein products.",
            "One strategy has been to incorporate non-native amino acids into proteins using aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that cannot discriminate between non-native amino acids that are structurally similar to their natural counterparts due to lack of proofreading mechanisms. Because the proofreading activity of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase has been disabled, structural analogs of natural amino acids that have been misactivated may escape the editing functions of the synthetase, and be incorporated into the growing peptide chain as desired. See, e.g., Doring et al., Science 292:501 (2001).",
            "A major limitation of the abovementioned strategy is that all sites corresponding to a particular natural amino acid throughout the protein are replaced. The extent of incorporation of the natural and non-native amino acid may also vary because it is difficult to completely deplete the cognate natural amino acid inside the cell. Another limitation is that these strategies make it difficult to study the mutant protein in living cells because the multi-site incorporation of analogs often results in toxicity. Finally, this method is applicable in general only to close structural analogs of the common amino acids, again because substitutions must be tolerated at all sites in the genome.",
            "More recently, orthogonal tRNAs and corresponding orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that charge the orthogonal tRNA with the desired non-native amino acid has been used as a strategy to overcome previous limitations. An orthogonal tRNA is a tRNA that base pairs with a codon that is not normally associated with an amino acid such as a stop codon or 4 base pair codon, etc. Importantly, orthogonal components do not cross-react with any of the endogenous tRNAs, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, amino acids, or codons in the host organism.",
            "A commonly used orthogonal system for the incorporation of non-native amino acids is the amber suppressor orthogonal tRNA. Using this system, a suppressor tRNA is prepared that recognizes the stop codon UAG and is chemically aminoacylated with a non-native amino acid. Conventional site-directed mutagenesis is used to introduce the stop codon TAG at the site of interest in the protein gene. When the aminoacylated suppressor tRNA and the mutant gene are combined in an in vitro transcription/translation system, the non-native amino acid is incorporated in response to the UAG codon which gives a protein containing the non-native amino acid at the specified position. See, e.g., Sayers et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 16:791-802 (1988). Evidence has shown that the desired non-native amino acid is incorporated at the position specified by the UAG codon and that the non-native amino acid is not incorporated at any other site in the protein. See, e.g., Noren et al., Science 244:182-88 (1989); Ellman et al., Science 255: 197-200 (1992). For additional discussion of orthogonal translation systems that incorporate non-native amino acids, and methods for their production and use, see also Wang and Schultz, Chem. Commun. 1:1-11 (2002); Xie and Schultz, Methods 36:227-38 (2005); Xie and Schultz, Curr. Opinion in Chemical Biology 9:548-554 (2005); Wang et al., Annu Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 35:225-49 (2006); and Xie and Schultz, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 7:775-82 (2006).",
            "However, the incorporation of non-native amino acids using orthogonal components suffers from much lower yields because it relies on inherently inefficient suppressor tRNAs competing with termination factors. In addition, the use of orthogonal components for incorporation of non-native amino acids has been restricted to selective incorporation of only a single non-native amino acid per protein at only one of the three nonsense termination codons (the UAG amber stop codon) because of competition at amino acid sense codons from natural amino acids catalyzed by the tRNA charging and proofreading activities of the twenty different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and because attempts to use a second termination codon (UGA) often fails due to read through by the ribosome. See, e.g., Cload et al., Chem. and Biol. 3:1033-38 (1996).",
            "While some attempts have been made to incorporate non-native amino acids into proteins using tRNAs that recognize sense codons, such attempts have been made using a pure reconstituted in vitro translation system. See Tan et al., Methods 36:279-90 (2005); Forster et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,977,150. However, such pure reconstituted translation systems require purified translational components, which is impractical outside of the context of research, very expensive, and not shown to be highly efficient.",
            "There exists a need in the art for incorporating non-native amino acids into a growing polypeptide chain, where orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pairs can be avoided, where native isoaccepting tRNAs aminoacylated with non-native amino acids recognize sense codons and subsequently incorporate the non-native amino acid into a growing polypeptide chain at a position defined by the sense codon, where numerous non-native amino acids can be incorporated at defined positions, and where a crude cell-free protein synthesis system can be used that avoids the impracticality, expense, and inefficiency of a pure reconstituted in vitro translation system. The invention described herein fulfills these and other needs, as will be apparent upon review of the following disclosure."

Also, there is evidence that prior infection with one type can produce an antibody response that can intensify, or enhance, the course of disease during a subsequent infection with a different serotype.

The RSV virion consists of an internal nucleocapsid comprised of the viral RNA bound to nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), and large polymerase protein (L). The nucleocapsid is surrounded by matrix protein (M) and is encapsulated by a lipid bilayer into which the viral fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins as well as the small hydrophobic protein (SH) are incorporated. The viral genome also encodes two nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2), which inhibit type I interferon activity as well as the M-2 protein.",

Recombinant technology, however, has been used to target the formation of vaccines for hPIV-1, 2 and 3 serotypes, for example, and has taken the form of several live-attenuated intranasal vaccines. Two vaccines in particular were found to be immunogenic and well tolerated against hPIV-3 in phase I trials. hPIV1 and hPIV2 vaccine candidates remain less advanced (Durbin and Karron, Clinical infectious diseases: an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America 2003; 37(12):1668-77).",
            "Measles virus (MeV), like hMPV, PIV3 and RSV, is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is the cause of measles, an infection of the respiratory system. MeV is of the genus  within the family Paramyxoviridae. Humans are the natural hosts of the virus; no animal reservoirs are known to exist. Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a generalized, maculopapular, erythematous rash. The virus is highly contagious and is spread by coughing",

They are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of zoonotic origin. The coronavirus genera are each composed of varying viral lineages, with the betacoronavirus genus containing four such lineages. The BetaCoVs of the greatest clinical importance concerning humans are OC43 and HKU1 of the A lineage, SARS-CoV of the B lineage, and MERS-CoV of the C lineage.

            "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus belonging to the Alphavirus genus of the Togaviridae family that was first isolated in 1953 in Tanzania, where the virus was endemic. Outbreaks occur repeatedly in west, central, and southern Africa and have caused several human epidemics in those areas since that time. The virus is passed to humans by two species of mosquito of the genus  and  . There are several Chikungunya genotypes: Indian Ocean, East/Central/South African (ECSA), Asian, West African, and Brazilian.",
            "Presently, CHIKV is a re-emerging human pathogen that has now established itself in Southeast Asia and has more recently spread to Europe. The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was introduced into Asia around 1958, and sites of endemic transmission within Southeastern Asia, including the Indian Ocean, were observed through 1996. The CHIKV epidemic moved throughout Asia, reaching Europe and Africa in the early 2000s, and was imported via travelers to North America and South America from 2005 to 2007. Sporadic outbreaks are still occurring in several countries, such as Italy, inflicting naive populations. Singapore, for instance, experienced two successive waves of Chikungunya virus outbreaks in January and August 2008. Of the two strain lineages of CHIKV, the African strain remains enzootic by cycling between mosquitoes and monkeys, but the Asian strain is transmitted directly between mosquitoes and humans. This cycle of transmission may have allowed the virus to become more pathogenic as the reservoir host was eliminated.",
            "In humans, CHIKV causes a debilitating disease characterized by fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, rash, muscle pain and joint pain. Following the acute phase of the illness, patients develop severe chronic symptoms lasting from several weeks to months, including fatigue, incapacitating joint pain and polyarthritis.",
            "The re-emergence of CHIKV has caused millions of cases throughout countries around the Indian Ocean and in Southeast Asia. Specifically, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar and Thailand have reported over 1.9 million cases since 2005. Globally, human CHIKV epidemics from 2004-2011 have resulted in 1.4-6.5 million reported cases, including a number of deaths. Thus, CHIKV remains a public threat that constitutes a major public health problem with severe social and economic impact.",
            "Despite significant morbidity and some cases of mortality associated with CHIKV infection and its growing prevalence and geographic distribution, there is currently no licensed CHIKV vaccine or antiviral approved for human use. Several potential CHIKV vaccine candidates have been tested in humans and animals with varying success.",

Dengue virus is a positive-sense RNA virus of the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family, which also includes West Nile virus, Yellow Fever Virus, and Japanese Encephalitis virus. It is transmitted to humans through  (formerly  ) mosquito vectors and is mainly found in the tropical and semitropical areas of the world, where it is endemic in Asia, the Pacific region, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The incidence of infections has increased 30-fold over the last 50 years (WHO, Dengue: Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control (2009)) and Dengue virus is the second most common tropical infectious disease worldwide after malaria.",
            "There is no specific treatment for DENV infection, and control of DENV by vaccination has proved elusive, in part, because the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS is not completely understood. While infection with one serotype confers lifelong homotypic immunity, it confers only short term (approximately three to six months) cross protection against heterotypic serotypes. Also, there is evidence that prior infection with one type can produce an antibody response that can intensify, or enhance, the course of disease during a subsequent infection with a different serotype. The possibility that vaccine components could elicit enhancing antibody responses, as opposed to protective responses, has been a major concern in designing and testing vaccines to protect against dengue infections.",
            "In late 2015 and early 2016, the first dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV) by Sanofi Pasteur, was registered in several countries for use in individuals 9-45 years of age living in endemic areas. Issues with the vaccine include (1) weak protection against DENV1 and DENV2 (<60% efficacy); (2) relative risk of dengue hospitalization among children <9 years old (7.5\u00d7 higher than placebo); (3) immunogenicity not sustained after 1-2 years (implying the need for a 4 dose booster); and (4) lowest efficacy against DENV2, which often causes more severe conditions. This latter point is a major weakness with the Dengvaxia vaccine, signaling the need of a new, more effective vaccine effective against DENV2. Other tetravalent live-attenuated vaccines are under development in phase II and phase III clinical trials, and other vaccine candidates (based on subunit, DNA and purified inactivated virus platforms) are at earlier stages of clinical development, although the ability of these vaccine candidates to provide broad serotype protection has not been demonstrated.",

It is related to dengue, yellow fever, West Nile and Japanese encephalitis, viruses that are also members of the virus family Flaviviridae. ZIKV is spread to people through mosquito bites. The most common symptoms of ZIKV disease (Zika) are fever, rash, joint pain, and red eye. The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week.

The orthomyxoviruses are enveloped animal viruses of approximately 100 nm in diameter. The influenza virions consist of an internal ribonucleoprotein core (a helical nucleocapsid) containing a single-stranded RNA genome, and an outer lipoprotein envelope lined inside by a matrix protein (M1). The segmented genome of influenza A virus consists of eight molecules (seven for influenza C virus) of linear, negative polarity, single-stranded RNAs, which encode several polypeptides including: the RNA-directed RNA polymerase proteins (PB2, PB1 and PA) and nucleoprotein (NP), which form the nucleocapsid; the matrix proteins (M1, M2, which is also a surface-exposed protein embedded in the virus membrane); two surface glycoproteins, which project from the lipoprotein envelope: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA); and nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2). Transcription and replication of the genome takes place in the nucleus and assembly takes place at the plasma membrane.",

The rapid evolution of the HA protein of the influenza virus results in the constant emergence of new strains, rendering the adaptive immune response of the host only partially protective to new infections. The biggest challenge for therapy and prophylaxis against influenza and other infections using traditional vaccines is the limitation of vaccines in breadth, providing protection only against closely related subtypes.

Blood is a fluid comprising, e.g., plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets that is circulated by the heart through the vertebrate vascular system. The circulatory system becomes a reservoir for many toxins and pathogenic molecules upon their introduction to or production by the body. The circulatory system also serves as a reservoir for cellular secretions or detritus from within the body. The perpetual or aberrant circulation and proliferation of such molecules and entities can drive disease and/or exacerbate existing conditions.",

The short half-life often necessitates repeated injections and hospitalizations. It is thought that the short half-life may be due to both renal clearance, e.g., of proteins smaller than 60 kDa, and non-renal clearance, e.g., via liver excretion or immune-mediated removal. The activity of therapies is also often limited by an immune reaction elicited against them (see, e.g., Wang et al., Leukemia 2003, 17:1583). Several approaches are practiced in the art.",
            "One approach includes the use of \u201cerythrocyte ghosts\u201d that are derived from a hemolyzed red blood cell. To prepare erythrocyte ghosts, red blood cells undergo hypotonic lysis. The red blood cells are exposed to low ionic strength buffer causing them to burst. The resulting lysed cell membranes are isolated by centrifugation. The pellet of lysed red blood cell membranes is resuspended and incubated in the presence of the therapeutic agent, for example, such as an antibiotic or chemotherapeutic agent in a low ionic strength buffer. The therapeutic agent distributes within the cells. Erythrocyte ghosts and derivatives used to encapsulate payloads, such as therapeutic agents, can shield those payloads from the immune system, but the erythrocyte ghosts themselves are subject to rapid clearance by the reticulo-endothelial system (see, e.g., Loegering et al. 1987 Infect Immun 55(9):2074). Erythrocyte ghosts also elicit an immune response in mammalian subjects. These vesicles are typically constituted of both lipids and proteins, including potentially high amounts of phosphatidylserine, which is normally found on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This leads to potential immunological reactions in the recipient mammalian subjects. The undesirable effects seriously limit the potential for therapeutic applications of technologies based on erythrocyte ghosts.",
            "Another approach for drug encapsulation includes the use of exosomes. \u201cExosomes\u201d include cell-derived vesicles that are present in many and perhaps all biological fluids, including blood, urine, and cultured medium of cell cultures. The reported diameter of exosomes is between 30 and 100 nm, which is larger than low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but smaller than, for example, red blood cells. Exosomes are either released from the cell when multivesicular bodies fuse with the plasma membrane or they are released directly from the plasma membrane. Exosome delivery methods require a better understanding of their biology, as well as the development of production, characterization, targeting and cargo-loading nanotechnologies. Attempts have been made to manufacture exosomes using human embryonic stem cell derived mesenchymal stem cells (hESC-MSCs). However, as hESC-MSCs are not infinitely expansible, large scale production of exosomes would require replenishment of hESC-MSC through derivation from hESCs and incur recurring costs for testing and validation of each new batch (Chen et al. 2011 Journal of Translational Medicine 9:47). Clinical translation is also hindered by the lack of suitable and scalable nanotechnologies for the purification and loading of exosomes (Lakhal and Wood 2011 BioEssays 33(10):737). Current ultracentrifugation protocols are commercially unreproducible, as they produce a heterogeneous mix of exosomes, other cellular vesicles and macromolecular complexes. Therefore, purification methods based on the use of specific, desired markers, such as the expression of a targeting moiety on the surface of the exosome, are required. In addition, siRNA loading into exosomes is relatively inefficient and cost-ineffective, highlighting the need for the development of transfection reagents tailored for nanoparticle applications. Further, exosomes are rapidly cleared from circulation and substantially accumulate in the liver within 24 hours of administration (Ohno et al., 2013 Mol Therapy 21(1):185), limiting their application for long-term drug delivery to the circulatory of a subject.",

A \u201cliposome\u201d includes an artificially-prepared spherical vesicle composed of a lamellar phase lipid bilayer.

Liposomes are often composed of phosphatidylcholine-enriched phospholipids and may also contain mixed lipid chains with surfactant properties such as egg phosphatidylethanolamine A liposome design may employ surface ligands for attaching to a target, e.g., unhealthy tissue.

Many of these applications require procedures for the transient opening of pores across the red cell membrane. Drugs have commonly been loaded into freshly isolated red blood cells, without culturing, using disruptive methods based on hypotonic shock.

            "Many drugs, particularly protein therapeutics, stimulate immunogenic responses that include B cell antibody production, T cell activation, and macrophage phagocytosis. The causes of immunogenicity can be extrinsic or intrinsic to the protein. Extrinsic factors are drug formulation, aggregate formation, degradation products, contaminants and dosing. The administration mode, as well as the drug regimen, also strongly influences how immunogenicity is assessed. That is, immunogenicity will have different effects for drugs that are given in acute indications compared to drugs to treat chronic diseases. In the latter case, patients are exposed to the drug over a longer period of time and as such can mount a complete response. Pegylation is a technology designed to prolong the half-life, as well as minimize immunogenic responses. In contrast to assumptions that polyethylene glycol (PEG) is non-immunogenic and non-antigenic, certain animal studies show that uricase, ovalbumin and some other PEGylated agents can elicit antibody formation against PEG (anti-PEG). In humans, anti-PEG may limit therapeutic efficacy and/or reduce tolerance of PEG-asparaginase (PEG-ASNase) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and of pegloticase in patients with chronic gout, but did not impair hyposensitization of allergic patients with mPEG-modified ragweed extract or honeybee venom or the response to PEG-IFN in patients with hepatitis C. Anti-PEG antibodies can be found in 22-25% of healthy blood donors. Two decades earlier, the occurrence was 0.2%. This increase may be due to an improvement of the limit of detection of antibodies and to greater exposure to PEG and PEG-containing compounds in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and processed food products. These results raise concerns regarding the efficacy of PEG-conjugated drugs for a subset of patients (Garay, Expert Opin Drug Deliv, 2012 9(11):1319).",
            "Attempts in the art to create passive half-life improvement methods focus on increasing the apparent hydrodynamic radius of a drug.

Kidney Int 1982 21:633. The main determinant of filtration is the hydrodynamic radius of the molecule in the blood; smaller molecules (<80 kDa) are filtered out of the blood to a higher extent than larger molecules. Researchers have used this generalized rule to modify drugs to exhibit a larger hydrodynamic radius and thus longer half-life, mainly via chemical conjugation to large molecular weight water-soluble polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). Numerous PEGylated protein and small molecule therapeutics are currently offered in the clinic (Pasut and Veronese, 2009 Adv Drug Deliv Rev 61(13):1177; Fishburn, 2008 J Pharm Sci 97(10):4167). Though effective in many cases in increasing circulation half-life, especially as the hydrodynamic radius of the graft or fusion increases (Gao, Liu, et al., 2009 PNAS 106(36):15231), these methods offer challenges in manufacturing and maintenance of biological effector function.

In this manner, the drug attains its large molecular size only after administration into the blood stream. The addition of affinity-matured serum albumin-binding peptides to antibody fragments increased their circulation time 24 fold in mice (Dennis et al, 2002 J Bil Chem 277(38):35035). This method is complicated by the dynamics of albumin recycle by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and the use of cysteine-constrained cyclic peptides for functionality. Alternatively, recombinant addition of large antibody fragments may be made to a protein drug. This may cause structural as well as manufacturing complications, e.g., because of the use of complex cyclic or large domains for functionality.

            "The potential of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, antibody-coupled T-cell receptor (ACTR) therapies and other adoptive T-cell therapies in effecting complete and durable responses has been demonstrated in a number of malignant and infectious diseases. The development of more potent T cells is limited, however, by safety concerns, highlighted by the occurrence of on-target and off-target toxicities that, although uncommon, have been fatal on occasions. Timely pharmacological intervention can be effective in the management of adverse events but adoptively transferred T cells can persist long term, along with any unwanted effects. T cells targeting differentiation antigens can be expected to also recognize nonmalignant cells that express the same antigens, resulting in adverse events. For example, melanoma patients treated with T cells targeting melanocyte differentiation antigens, such as MART-1 and gp100, often develop vitiligo and uveitis. These on-target toxicities have been observed across all forms of therapeutic approaches, including tumor-infiltrating cells, in vitro-expanded T-cell clones and TCR-transgenic cells. In general, on-target autoimmunity is associated with tumor regression and is more prominent in treatment approaches that are more efficacious. On-target but off-tumour toxicities can be immediately life-threatening. For example, patients with colorectal cancer with lung and liver metastases may develop respiratory distress within 15 min of HER2-specific CAR T-cell infusion and may subsequently die from multiorgan failure 5 days later. As T-cell therapy becomes more effective, acute toxicities have also become more evident. Cytokine release syndrome, which is characterized by fevers, rigors, hypotension and hypoxia, has been observed in a number of CD19 CAR T-cell studies as a result of large-scale T-cell activation upon the recognition of CD19+ malignant cells.",

Polypeptides used to treat a range of human diseases are often destroyed, neutralized, or otherwise rendered ineffective by immune cells that respond to them as though they were foreign antigens. This powerful alloresponse by the adaptive and/or innate immune system is often controlled by administration of immunosuppressive drugs. However, treatments with immunosuppressive drugs are associated with significant morbidities because they broadly suppress the immune system. Furthermore, the toxicity of immunosuppressive drugs raises other issues. Thus, the success of immunogenic polypeptide administration often depends on the balance between rejection and the side effects of modern immunosuppressive drugs.",

Early technologies developed to insert a transgene into a living cell were often limited by the random nature of the insertion location of the new sequence into the genome. Random insertions into the genome may result in disruption of normal regulation of neighboring genes leading to severe unintended effects. Furthermore, random integration technologies offer little reproducibility, as there is no guarantee that the sequence would be inserted at the same place in two different cells.

The red blood cells are exposed to low ionic strength buffer causing them to burst. The resulting lysed cell membranes are isolated by centrifugation. The pellet of lysed red blood cell membranes is resuspended and incubated in the presence of the therapeutic agent, for example, such as an antibiotic or chemotherapeutic agent in a low ionic strength buffer. The therapeutic agent distributes within the cells. Erythrocyte ghosts and derivatives used to encapsulate payloads, such as therapeutic agents, can shield those payloads from the immune system, but the erythrocyte ghosts themselves are subject to rapid clearance by the reticulo-endothelial system (see, e.g., Loegering et al. 1987 Infect Immun 55(9):2074). Erythrocyte ghosts also elicit an immune response in mammalian subjects. These vesicles are typically constituted of both lipids and proteins, including potentially high amounts of phosphatidylserine, which is normally found on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.

            "The potential of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, antibody-coupled T-cell receptor (ACTR) therapies and other adoptive T-cell therapies in effecting complete and durable responses has been demonstrated in a number of malignant and infectious diseases. The development of more potent T cells is limited, however, by safety concerns, highlighted by the occurrence of on-target and off-target toxicities that, although uncommon, have been fatal on occasions. Timely pharmacological intervention can be effective in the management of adverse events but adoptively transferred T cells can persist long term, along with any unwanted effects. T cells targeting differentiation antigens can be expected to also recognize nonmalignant cells that express the same antigens, resulting in adverse events. For example, melanoma patients treated with T cells targeting melanocyte differentiation antigens, such as MART-1 and gp100, often develop vitiligo and uveitis. These on-target toxicities have been observed across all forms of therapeutic approaches, including tumor-infiltrating cells, in vitro-expanded T-cell clones and TCR-transgenic cells. In general, on-target autoimmunity is associated with tumor regression and is more prominent in treatment approaches that are more efficacious. On-target but off-tumour toxicities can be immediately life-threatening. For example, patients with colorectal cancer with lung and liver metastases may develop respiratory distress within 15 min of HER2-specific CAR T-cell infusion and may subsequently die from multiorgan failure 5 days later. As T-cell therapy becomes more effective, acute toxicities have also become more evident. Cytokine release syndrome, which is characterized by fevers, rigors, hypotension and hypoxia, has been observed in a number of CD19 CAR T-cell studies as a result of large-scale T-cell activation upon the recognition of CD19+ malignant cells.",

            "There are multiple problems with prior methodologies of effecting protein expression. For example, heterologous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) introduced into a cell can be inherited by daughter cells (whether or not the heterologous DNA has integrated into the chromosome) or by offspring. Introduced DNA can integrate into host cell genomic DNA at some frequency, resulting in alterations and/or damage to the host cell genomic DNA. In addition, multiple steps must occur before a protein is made. Once inside the cell, DNA must be transported into the nucleus where it is transcribed into RNA. The RNA transcribed from DNA must then enter the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. This need for multiple processing steps creates lag times before the generation of a protein of interest. Further, it is difficult to obtain DNA expression in cells; frequently DNA enters cells but is not expressed or not expressed at reasonable rates or concentrations. This can be a particular problem when DNA is introduced into cells such as primary cells or modified cell lines. The role of nucleoside modifications on the immuno-stimulatory potential, stability, and on the translation efficiency of RNA, and the consequent benefits to this for enhancing protein expression and producing therapeutics have been previously explored.

            "There are many challenges associated with the delivery of nucleic acids to effect a desired response in a biological system. Nucleic acid based therapeutics have enormous potential but there remains a need for more effective delivery of nucleic acids to appropriate sites within a cell or organism in order to realize this potential. Therapeutic nucleic acids include, e.g., messenger RNA (mRNA), antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, DNAzymes, plasmids, immune stimulating nucleic acids, antagomir, antimir, mimic, supermir, and aptamers. Some nucleic acids, such as mRNA or plasmids, can be used to effect expression of specific cellular products as would be useful in the treatment of, for example, diseases related to a deficiency of a protein or enzyme. The therapeutic applications of translatable nucleotide delivery are extremely broad as constructs can be synthesized to produce any chosen protein sequence, whether or not indigenous to the system. The expression products of the nucleic acid can augment existing levels of protein, replace missing or non-functional versions of a protein, or introduce new protein and associated functionality in a cell or organism.",
            "Some nucleic acids, such as miRNA inhibitors, can be used to effect expression of specific cellular products that are regulated by miRNA as would be useful in the treatment of, for example, diseases related to deficiency of protein or enzyme. The therapeutic applications of miRNA inhibition are extremely broad as constructs can be synthesized to inhibit one or more miRNA that would in turn regulate the expression of mRNA products. The inhibition of endogenous miRNA can augment its downstream target endogenous protein expression and restore proper function in a cell or organism as a means to treat disease associated to a specific miRNA or a group of miRNA.",
            "Other nucleic acids can down-regulate intracellular levels of specific mRNA and, as a result, down-regulate the synthesis of the corresponding proteins through processes such as RNA interference (RNAi) or complementary binding of antisense RNA. The therapeutic applications of antisense oligonucleotide and RNAi are also extremely broad, since oligonucleotide constructs can be synthesized with any nucleotide sequence directed against a target mRNA. Targets may include mRNAs from normal cells, mRNAs associated with disease-states, such as cancer, and mRNAs of infectious agents, such as viruses. To date, antisense oligonucleotide constructs have shown the ability to specifically down-regulate target proteins through degradation of the cognate mRNA in both in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, antisense oligonucleotide constructs are currently being evaluated in clinical studies.",
            "However, two problems currently face using oligonucleotides in therapeutic contexts. First, free RNAs are susceptible to nuclease digestion in plasma. Second, free RNAs have limited ability to gain access to the intracellular compartment where the relevant translation machinery resides. Lipid nanoparticles formed from cationic lipids with other lipid components, such as neutral lipids, cholesterol, PEG, PEGylated lipids, and oligonucleotides have been used to block degradation of the RNAs in plasma and facilitate the cellular uptake of the oligonucleotides.",
            "There remains a need for improved cationic lipids and lipid nanoparticles for the delivery of oligonucleotides. Preferably, these lipid nanoparticles would provide optimal drug:lipid ratios, protect the nucleic acid from degradation and clearance in serum, be suitable for systemic delivery, and provide intracellular delivery of the nucleic acid. In addition, these lipid-nucleic acid particles should be well-tolerated and provide an adequate therapeutic index, such that patient treatment at an effective dose of the nucleic acid is not associated with unacceptable toxicity and/or risk to the patient. The present invention provides these and related advantages."

Typical conjugation sites include random locations on polypeptide chains, e.g. random amines on amino acid residue side chains, and the N-terminus of certain polypeptide chains. In such cases, some polypeptides might be linked to a payload at one location while some polypeptides are linked to the same payload at another location, and some polypeptides might not be linked at all.

            "RNA polymerases exhibit three phases of transcription\u2014initiation, elongation and termination. During the initiation phase, the RNA polymerase binds to a specific promoter DNA sequence, opens the DNA duplex and feeds the template strand into the active site. T7 RNA polymerase, for example, forms a structure referred to as initiation complex, which includes a six-helix bundle sub-domain (the promoter binding domain) that interacts with the promoter to initiate DNA duplex melting. While bound to the promoter, the polymerase produces many short (truncated) transcripts from 2-12 nucleotides (nt) in length, a process often referred to as abortive synthesis/initiation. The truncated RNA transcripts cannot be converted to full-length transcripts by RNA polymerase and become by-products that accumulate during transcription. After the transition to the elongation phase and release of the promoter, the polymerase proceeds down the DNA template producing a full-length RNA transcript.",
            "During the elongation phase, RNA polymerase often continues to transcribe DNA beyond the point at which termination should be initiated, generating longer than expected RNA transcripts (\u201crun-on transcripts\u201d). T7 RNA polymerase, for example, adds nucleotides to the end of a transcript before \u2018falling off\u2019 the template. Studies suggest that more than 70% of transcripts generated by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro may be run-on transcripts.

            "Hemophilia A (HemA) is caused by a genetic defect in the FVIII gene (F8) that results in low or undetectable levels of FVIII protein in the blood. This results in ineffective clot formation at sites of tissue injury leading to uncontrolled bleeding that can be fatal if not treated. Replacement of the missing or nonfunctional FVIII protein is an effective treatment for HemA subjects and is the current standard of care. However, protein replacement therapy requires frequent intravenous administration of FVIII protein which is inconvenient in adults, problematic in children, cost prohibitive (>S200,000/year), and can result in break through bleeding events if the treatment regimen is not closely followed.",
            "A permanent cure for hemophilia A is highly desirable. While virus-based gene therapy using Adeno Associated Virus (AAV) has shown some promise in preclinical animal models and in human subjects, it has a number of disadvantages. For example, reported AAV based gene therapy uses a FVIII coding sequence driven by a liver-specific promoter that is encapsulated inside an AAV virus capsid (generally using the serotypes AAV5, AAV8 or AAV9 or AAVrh10, among others). In general, AAV viruses used for gene therapy deliver the packaged coding sequence cassette into the nucleus of the transduced cells, where the cassette remains almost exclusively episomal, and it is the episomal copies of the therapeutic coding sequence that give rise to the therapeutic protein. AAV does not have a mechanism to integrate the encapsulated DNA into the genome of the host cells. Because the therapeutic coding sequence is maintained as an episome, it is not coordinately replicated when the host cell divides so can be lost from daughter cells. It has been demonstrated that when liver cells containing AAV episomes are induced to divide, the AAV genome is not replicated but is instead diluted. Accordingly, AAV based gene therapy is not expected to be effective in children whose livers have not yet achieved adult size. Because current therapies are inadequate, there is a critical need for new effective and permanent or long-lasting treatments for HemA for adults and children.",
            "FVIII is initially expressed as a protein having the domain structure A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. The protein is activated by proteolytic cleavage of the bulky, heavily glycosylated B domain, leaving a heavy chain (A1-A2) and light chain (A3-C1-C2) heterodimer. The B domain of the FVIII protein is not required for biological activity. Removal of the large B domain from the FVIII coding sequence is essential to enable reliable packaging into AAV vectors used for in vivo delivery. However, removal of the B domain, which contains up to 18 N-linked glycosylation sites, results in impaired secretion of FVIII protein. Thus, there is a critical need for improved forms of FVIII which can be efficiently and effectively expressed."

            "Human coronaviruses are highly contagious enveloped, positive single stranded RNA viruses of the Coronaviridae family. They are the common etiological agents of mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections. Outbreaks of novel coronavirus infections such as the infections caused by a Wuhan coronavirus, however, have been associated with a high mortality rate death toll. A Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) (formerly referred to as a \u201cWuhan coronavirus,\u201d a \u201c2019 novel coronavirus,\u201d or a \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d) was initially identified from the Chinese city Wuhan in December 2019 and has rapidly infected hundreds of thousands of people. The pandemic disease the Wuhan/SARSCoV-2 virus causes has been named by WHO as COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019). The first genome sequence of a SARS-CoV-2 (also referred to as 2019 nCoV) isolate (Wuhan-Hu-1) was deposited in GenBank on Jan. 12, 2020 by investigators from the Chinese CDC in Beijing."

Approximately 30% to 35% of mothers with primary CMV infection during pregnancy will transmit the virus to the fetus; 12% of these newborns will have symptomatic disease, and approximately 4% will die in the first year of life. In addition, approximately half of CMV-infected infants who are symptomatic at birth will develop late complications such as intellectual disability, sensorineural hearing loss, and developmental delay.

        "paragraph": [
            "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a genus of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae, in the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae. There are currently eight species in this genus, which have been identified and classified for different mammals, including humans, monkeys, and rodents. The most studied genus is human cytomegalovirus, also known as human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), which is widely distributed in the human population. Diseases associated with HHV-5 include mononucleosis and pneumonias. All herpesviruses share a characteristic ability to remain latent within the body over long periods of time. Although they may be found throughout the body, CMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands in humans and other mammals. Other CMV viruses are found in several mammal species, but species isolated from animals differ from HCMV in terms of genomic structure, and have not been reported to cause human disease.",
            "HCMV is endemic in most parts of the world. It is a ubiquitous large enveloped virus that infects 50 to 100% of the adult population worldwide. Although generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent hosts, HCMV infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised persons, such as infants following congenital or neonatal infections, transplant recipients, or AIDS patients.",
            "Primary infection normally results in subclinical disease after which the virus becomes latent, retaining the capacity to reactivate at a later time. The virus is transmitted through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk. In particular, individuals with undeveloped or compromised immunity are highly sensitive to infection by HCMV. It is estimated that at least 60% of the US population has been exposed to CMV, with a prevalence of more than 90% in high-risk groups (e.g., unborn babies whose mothers become infected with CMV during the pregnancy or people with HIV).",
            "In healthy individuals, HCMV typically causes an asymptomatic infection or produces mild, flulike symptoms. However, among two populations, HCMV is responsible for serious medical conditions. First, HCMV is a major cause of congenital defects in newborns infected in utero. Among congenitally infected newborns, 5-10% have major clinical symptoms at birth, such as microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, and hepatitis, as well as cytomegalic inclusion disease, which affects many tissues and organs including the central nervous system, liver, and retina and can lead to multi-organ failure and death. Other infants may be asymptomatic at birth, but later develop hearing loss or central nervous system abnormalities causing, in particular, poor intellectual performance and mental retardation. These pathologies are due in part to the ability of HCMV to enter and replicate in diverse cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, neurons, and monocytes/macrophages.",
            "The second population at risk are immunocompromised patients, such as those suffering from HIV infection and those undergoing transplantations. In this situation, the virus becomes an opportunistic pathogen and causes severe disease with high morbidity and mortality. The clinical disease causes a variety of symptoms including fever, pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, myelitis, colitis, uveitis, retinitis, and neuropathy. Rarer manifestations of HCMV infections in immunocompetent individuals include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, meningoencephalitis, pericarditis, myocarditis, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. Moreover, HCMV infection increases the risk of organ graft loss through transplant vascular sclerosis and restenosis, and may increase atherosclerosis in transplant patients as well as in the general population. It is estimated that HCMV infection causes clinical disease in 75% of patients in the first year after transplantation.",
            "There is currently no approved HCMV vaccine. Two candidate vaccines, Towne and gB/MF59, have completed phase II efficacy trials. The Towne vaccine appears protective against both infection and disease caused by challenge with pathogenic Toledo strain and also appears to be effective in preventing severe post-transplantation CMV disease. However, in a small phase II clinical trial, a low dose of Towne vaccine failed to show protection against infection of seronegative mothers who had children actively shedding CMV.",
            "The gB/MF59 vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine comprised of a transmembrane-deleted version of HCMV gB protein, which induces high levels of fibroblast entry neutralizing antibodies in humans and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in both adults and toddlers. A recent phase II double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the gB/MF59 vaccine revealed a 50% efficacy in inducing sterilizing immunity. As this vaccine induces potent antibody responses but very weak T-cell responses, the partial efficacy provided by the vaccine is thought to be primarily antibody-mediated. While this HCMV vaccine is the first to show any protective efficacy, its 50% protection falls short of the 80-90% desired for most vaccines.",
            "In addition, antibody therapy has been used to control HCMV infection in immunocompromised individuals and to reduce the pathological consequences of maternal-fetal transmission, although such therapy is usually not sufficient to eradicate the virus. HCMV immunoglobulins (Igs) have been administered to transplant patients in association with immunosuppressive treatments for prophylaxis of HCMV disease with mixed results. Antibody therapy has also been used to control congenital infection and prevent disease in newborns. However, these products are plasma derivatives with relatively low potency and have to be administered by intravenous infusion at very high doses in order to deliver sufficient amounts of neutralizing antibodies.",
            "HCMV is the leading viral cause of neurodevelopmental abnormality and other birth defects in children and the costs to society are substantial. Although antiviral therapy is available, the treatment with antiviral agents is imperfect and development of a CMV vaccine is the most promising strategy for preventing CMV infection. Given that the health and economic benefits of effective HCMV vaccines are significant, the US Institute of Medicine and US National Vaccine Program Office has categorized development of a CMV vaccine as a highest priority, but no candidate vaccine is under consideration for licensure."

Such buildup of fatty acids can damage internal organs, resulting in a wide-range of symptoms. Clinically, there are three different types of VLCADD, with each type exhibiting different onset and/or severity. Andresen, B. et al.,  64:479-494 (1999). The most severe form of the disorder is \u201cearly\u201d VLCADD. Signs and symptoms (e.g., hypoglycemia, irritability, and lethargy) usually appear between birth and four months. Left untreated, early VLCADD results in high mortality with majority of the patients dying from cardiomyopathy. In contrast, the \u201cchildhood\u201d and \u201cadult\u201d forms of VLCADD often have much milder signs and symptoms (e.g., hypoglycemia and muscle weakness) that can be exacerbated by illness or long periods of fasting.

Patients from all ethnic groups have been reported, and males and females are affected equally. Current treatment for VLCADD is primarily via dietary control (e.g., low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet with frequent feedings to avoid extended periods of fasting) in order to limit the usage of metabolic pathways required for the breakdown of very long-chain fatty acids. Solis, J. et al.,  102:1800-1803 (2002). However, such treatment often fails to completely or reliably control the disorder. Therefore, there is a need for improved therapy to treat VLCADD.",
            "The principal gene associated with VLCADD is acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, very long-chain (NM_000018.3; NP_000009.1; also referred to as ACADVL, VLCAD, ACAD6, or LCACD). Moczulski, D. et al.,  63: 266-277 (2009). ACADVL is a metabolic enzyme (E.C. 1.3.8.9), which plays a critical role in the catabolism of long-chain fatty acids, with highest specificity for carbon lengths C14-C18. Keeler, A M et al.,  20: 1131-38 (2012). ACADVL's biological function is to catalyze the first step of the mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. ACADVL localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it functions as a homodimer. Souri, M. et al.,  426:187-190 (1998). The precursor form of human ACADVL is 655 amino acids in length, while its mature form is 615 amino acids long\u2014a 40 amino acid leader sequence is cleaved off by mitochondrial importation and processing machinery. Souri, M. et al.,  58:97-106 (1996). This leader sequence is referred to as ACADVL's mitochondrial transit peptide.",
            "Mutations within the ACADVL gene can result in the complete or partial loss of ACADVL function, resulting in the abnormal buildup of very long-chain fatty acids in the plasma and the attendant signs and symptoms described above. Moczulski, D. et al.,  63: 266-277 (2009). Nonetheless, there is currently no available therapeutic for VLCADD that completely or reliably controls the disorder. As such, there is a need for improved therapy to treat VLCADD."

For example, influenza infections are the seventh leading cause of death in the United States with 200,000 hospitalizations and 40,000 deaths seen in the United States per year and cause about 3-5 million hospitalizations and about 300,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide per year. Millions of people receive flu vaccines to protect them from seasonal flu each year. Vaccination can also rapidly prevent the spread of an emerging influenze pandemic.",
            "A typical vaccine contains an agent that resembles a weakened or dead form of the disease-causing agent, which could be a microorganism, such as bacteria, virus, fungi, parasites, or one or more toxins and/or one or more proteins, for example, surface proteins, (i.e., antigens) of such a microorganism. The antigen or agent in the vaccine can stimulate the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a foreign invader, generate antibodies against it, destroy it and develop a memory of it. The vaccine-induced memory enables the immune system to act quickly to protect the body from any of these agents that it later encounters.",
            "Vaccine production used in the art e.g., antigen vaccine production, has several stages, including the generation of antigens, antigen purification and inactivation, and vaccine formulation. First, the antigen is generated through culturing viruses in cell lines, growing bacteria in bioreactors, or producing recombinant proteins derived from viruses and bacteria in cell cultures, yeast or bacteria. Recombinant proteins are then purified and the viruses and bacteria are inactivated before they are formulated with adjuvants in vaccines. It has been a challenge to drastically reduce the time and expense associated with current technologies in vaccine development.",
            "Another obstacle to the development of new vaccine is the constant evolution of most infectious agents, such as viruses and bacteria. Viruses often mutate their surface proteins to generate new antigens which can help them skipping the active immune system that has been immunized by vaccines containing the viruses, in contrast, bacteria acquire and mutate key proteins to evade host defense and effective antibiotic applications.",
            "For example, influenza A, B and C viruses are the etiological agents of influenza. Hemagglutinin (HA), the major envelop glycoprotein of influenza A and B viruses, or its homologue, hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) in influenza C virus, is the natural reservoir of the viruses. The rapid evolution of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the influenza virus results in the constant emergence of new strains, rendering the adaptive immune response of the host only partially protective to new infections. The biggest challenge for therapy and prophylaxis against influenza and other infections using traditional vaccines is the limitation of vaccines in breadth, providing protection only against closely related subtypes. In addition, today's length of the production process inhibits any fast reaction to develop and produce an adapted vaccine in a pandemic situation.",
            "It is of great interest to develop new vaccines as well as new approaches to combatting infectious disease and infectious agents."

        "paragraph": [
            "The human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus of the genus  and of the family Paramyxoviridae. Symptoms in adults typically resemble a sinus infection or the common cold, although the infection may be asymptomatic. In older adults (e.g., >60 years), RSV infection may progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Symptoms in children are often more severe, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia. It is estimated that in the United States, most children are infected with RSV by the age of three. The RSV virion consists of an internal nucleocapsid comprised of the viral RNA bound to nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), and large polymerase protein (L). The nucleocapsid is surrounded by matrix protein (M) and is encapsulated by a lipid bilayer into which the viral fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins as well as the small hydrophobic protein (SH) are incorporated. The viral genome also encodes two nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2), which inhibit type I interferon activity as well as the M-2 protein.",

With this technique, however, comes potential problems, including the possibility of insertional mutagenesis, which could lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inhibition of tumor suppressor genes."

        "paragraph": [
            "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a genus of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae, in the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae. There are currently eight species in this genus, which have been identified and classified for different mammals, including humans, monkeys, and rodents. The most studied genus is human cytomegalovirus, also known as human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), which is widely distributed in the human population. Diseases associated with HHV-5 include mononucleosis and pneumonias. All herpesviruses share a characteristic ability to remain latent within the body over long periods of time. Although they may be found throughout the body, CMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands in humans and other mammals. Other CMV viruses are found in several mammal species, but species isolated from animals differ from HCMV in terms of genomic structure, and have not been reported to cause human disease.",
            "HCMV is endemic in most parts of the world. It is a ubiquitous large enveloped virus that infects 50 to 100% of the adult population worldwide. Although generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent hosts, HCMV infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised persons, such as infants following congenital or neonatal infections, transplant recipients, or AIDS patients.",
            "Primary infection normally results in subclinical disease after which the virus becomes latent, retaining the capacity to reactivate at a later time. The virus is transmitted through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk. In particular, individuals with undeveloped or compromised immunity are highly sensitive to infection by HCMV. It is estimated that at least 60% of the US population has been exposed to CMV, with a prevalence of more than 90% in high-risk groups (e.g., unborn babies whose mothers become infected with CMV during the pregnancy or people with HIV).",
            "In healthy individuals, HCMV typically causes an asymptomatic infection or produces mild, flulike symptoms. However, among two populations, HCMV is responsible for serious medical conditions. First, HCMV is a major cause of congenital defects in newborns infected in utero. Among congenitally infected newborns, 5-10% have major clinical symptoms at birth, such as microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, and hepatitis, as well as cytomegalic inclusion disease, which affects many tissues and organs including the central nervous system, liver, and retina and can lead to multi-organ failure and death. Other infants may be asymptomatic at birth, but later develop hearing loss or central nervous system abnormalities causing, in particular, poor intellectual performance and mental retardation. These pathologies are due in part to the ability of HCMV to enter and replicate in diverse cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, neurons, and monocytes/macrophages.",
            "The second population at risk are immunocompromised patients, such as those suffering from HIV infection and those undergoing transplantations. In this situation, the virus becomes an opportunistic pathogen and causes severe disease with high morbidity and mortality. The clinical disease causes a variety of symptoms including fever, pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, myelitis, colitis, uveitis, retinitis, and neuropathy. Rarer manifestations of HCMV infections in immunocompetent individuals include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, meningoencephalitis, pericarditis, myocarditis, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. Moreover, HCMV infection increases the risk of organ graft loss through transplant vascular sclerosis and restenosis, and may increase atherosclerosis in transplant patients as well as in the general population. It is estimated that HCMV infection causes clinical disease in 75% of patients in the first year after transplantation.",
            "There is currently no approved HCMV vaccine. Two candidate vaccines, Towne and gB/MF59, have completed phase II efficacy trials. The Towne vaccine appears protective against both infection and disease caused by challenge with pathogenic Toledo strain and also appears to be effective in preventing severe post-transplantation CMV disease. However, in a small phase II clinical trial, a low dose of Towne vaccine failed to show protection against infection of seronegative mothers who had children actively shedding CMV.",
            "The gB/MF59 vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine comprised of a transmembrane-deleted version of HCMV gB protein, which induces high levels of fibroblast entry neutralizing antibodies in humans and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in both adults and toddlers. A recent phase II double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the gB/MF59 vaccine revealed a 50% efficacy in inducing sterilizing immunity. As this vaccine induces potent antibody responses but very weak T-cell responses, the partial efficacy provided by the vaccine is thought to be primarily antibody-mediated. While this HCMV vaccine is the first to show any protective efficacy, its 50% protection falls short of the 80-90% desired for most vaccines.",
            "In addition, antibody therapy has been used to control HCMV infection in immunocompromised individuals and to reduce the pathological consequences of maternal-fetal transmission, although such therapy is usually not sufficient to eradicate the virus. HCMV immunoglobulins (Igs) have been administered to transplant patients in association with immunosuppressive treatments for prophylaxis of HCMV disease with mixed results. Antibody therapy has also been used to control congenital infection and prevent disease in newborns. However, these products are plasma derivatives with relatively low potency and have to be administered by intravenous infusion at very high doses in order to deliver sufficient amounts of neutralizing antibodies.",
            "HCMV is the leading viral cause of neurodevelopmental abnormality and other birth defects in children and the costs to society are substantial. Although antiviral therapy is available, the treatment with antiviral agents is imperfect and development of a CMV vaccine is the most promising strategy for preventing CMV infection. Given that the health and economic benefits of effective HCMV vaccines are significant, the US Institute of Medicine and US National Vaccine Program Office has categorized development of a CMV vaccine as a highest priority, but no candidate vaccine is under consideration for licensure."

            "In addition, assuming proper delivery and no damage or integration into the host genome, there are multiple steps which must occur before the encoded protein is made. Once inside the cell, DNA must be transported into the nucleus where it is transcribed into RNA. The RNA transcribed from DNA must then enter the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. Not only do the multiple processing steps from administered DNA to protein create lag times before the generation of the functional protein, each step represents an opportunity for error and damage to the cell. Further, it is known to be difficult to obtain DNA expression in cells as DNA frequently enters a cell but is not expressed or not expressed at reasonable rates or concentrations. This can be a particular problem when DNA is introduced into primary cells or modified cell lines.",

The universal donor cells comprise at least one genetic modification within or near at least one gene that encodes a survival factor, wherein the genetic modification comprises an insertion of a polynucleotide encoding a tolerogenic factor.

        "paragraph": [
            "Various approaches have been proposed to overcome allogeneic rejection of transplanted or engrafted cells including HLA-matching, blocking pathways that trigger T-cell activation with antibodies, use of a cocktail of immune suppressive drugs, and autologous cell therapy. Another strategy to dampen graft rejection involves minimization of allogenic differences between transplanted or engrafted cells and the recipient. The cell surface-expressed human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), molecules encoded by genes located in the human major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6, are the major mediators of immune rejection. Mismatch of a single HLA gene between the donor and subject can cause a robust immune response (Fleischhauer K. et al. \u201cBone marrow-allograft rejection by T lymphocytes recognizing a single amino acid difference in HLA-B44,\u201d N Engl J Med., 1990, 323:1818-1822). HLA genes are divided into MHC class I (MHC-I) and MHC class II (MHC-II). MHC-I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) are expressed in almost all tissue cell types, presenting \u201cnon-self\u201d antigen-processed peptides to CD8+ T cells, thereby promoting their activation to cytolytic CD8+ T cells. Transplanted or engrafted cells expressing \u201cnon-self\u201d MHC-I molecules will cause a robust cellular immune response directed at these cells and ultimately resulting in their demise by activated cytolytic CD8+ T cells. MHC-I proteins are intimately associated with beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for forming functional MHC-I molecules on the cell surface.",
            "In contrast to the wide cellular expression of MHC-I genes, expression of MHC-II genes is restricted to antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. HLA antigen genes are the most polymorphic genes observed in the human genome (Rubinstein P., \u201cHLA matching for bone marrow transplantation\u2014how much is enough?\u201d N Engl J Med., 2001, 345:1842-1844). The generation of a \u201cuniversal donor\u201d cell that is compatible with any HLA genotype provides an alternative strategy that could resolve the immune rejection and associated economical costs of current methodologies for immune evasion.",
            "To generate such a line of universal donor cell(s), one previous approach has been to functionally disrupt the expression of MHC-I and MHC-II class genes. This could be achieved through genetic disruption, e.g., of both genetic alleles encoding the MHC-I light chain, B2M. The resulting B2M-null cell line and its derivatives would be expected to exhibit greatly reduced surface MHC-I and thus, reduced immunogenicity to allogeneic CD8+ T cells. The transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) targeting approach has been used to generate B2M-deficient hESC lines by deletion of a few nucleotides in exon 2 of the B2M gene (Lu, P. et al., \u201cGenerating hypoimmunogenic human embryonic stem cells by the disruption of beta 2-microglobulin,\u201d Stem Cell Rev. 2013, 9:806-813). Although the B2M-targeted hESC lines appeared to be surface HLA-I deficient, they were found to still contain mRNAs specific for B2M and MHC-I. The B2M and MHC-I mRNAs were expressed at levels equivalent to those of untargeted hESCs (both constitutive and IFN-g induced). Thus, concern exists that these TALEN B2M-targeted hESC lines might express residual cell surface MHC-I that would be sufficient to cause immune rejection, such as has been observed with B2M2/2 mouse cells that also express B2M mRNA (Gross, R. and Rappuoli, R. \u201cPertussis toxin promoter sequences involved in modulation,\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci, 1993, 90:3913-3917). Although the TALEN B2M targeted hESC lines were not examined for off-target cleavage events, the occurrence of nonspecific cleavage when using TALENs remains a significant issue that would impose a major safety concern on their clinical use (Grau, J. et al. \u201cTALEN offer: genome-wide TALEN off-target prediction,\u201d Bioinformatics, 2013, 29:2931-2932; Guilinger J. P. et al. \u201cBroad specificity profiling of TALENs results in engineered nucleases with improved DNA-cleavage specificity,\u201d Nat Methods 2014, 11:429-435). Further, another report generated IPS cells that escaped allogeneic recognition by knocking out a first B2M allele and knocking in a HLA-E gene at a second B2M allele, which resulted in surface expression of HLA-E dimers or trimers in the absence of surface expression of HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C (Gornalusse, G. G. et al., \u201cHLA-E-expressing pluripotent stem cells escape allogeneic responses and lysis by NK cells,\u201d Nature Biotechnology, 2017, 35, 765-773).",
            "A potential limitation of some of the above strategies are that MHC class I-negative cells are susceptible to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells as HLA molecules serve as major ligand inhibitors to natural killer (NK) cells. Host NK cells have been shown to eliminate transplanted or engrafted B2M\u2212/\u2212 donor cells, and a similar phenomenon occurs in vitro with MHC class-I-negative human leukemic lines (Bix, M. et al., \u201cRejection of class I MHC-deficient haemopoietic cells by irradiated MHC-matched mice,\u201d Nature, 1991, 349, 329-331; Zarcone, D. et al., \u201cHuman leukemia-derived cell lines and clones as models for mechanistic analysis of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity,\u201d Cancer Res. 1987, 47, 2674-2682). Thus, there exists a need to improve upon previous methods to generate universal donor cells that can evade the immune response as well as a need to generate cells that can survive post-engraftment. As described herein, cell survival post-engraftment may be mediated by a host of other pathways independent of allogeneic rejection e.g., hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress. Also as described herein, genetic introduction of survival factors (genes and/or proteins) may help cells to survive post-engraftment. As described herein, a universal donor cell line may combine properties that address both allogeneic rejection and survival post-engraftment."

            "Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is a metabolic disorder characterized by the abnormal buildup of the metabolic byproduct methylmalonic acid in patients. MMA causes developmental delay, intellectual disability, kidney disease, coma, or even death. MMA is also referred to as methylmalonic aciduria. It has an estimated incidence of 1 in 50,000 to 100,000. Current treatment for MMA is primarily via dietary control to limit the usage of metabolic pathways that lead to methylmalonic acid formation. In serious cases, kidney and liver transplants have also been performed to provide a new reservoir of cells that can properly metabolize and remove the methylmalonic acid. However, none of these treatments completely or reliably controls the disorder. As such there is a need for improved therapy to treat MMA.",
            "The principal gene associated with MMA is methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (NM 000255; NP 000246; also referred to as MCM or MUT). MCM is a metabolic enzyme (E.C. 5.4.99.2) that plays a critical role in the catabolism of various amino acids, fatty acids, and cholesterol. MCM's biological function is to isomerize L-methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA, a Krebs cycle intermediate. MCM localizes to the mitochondria of cells, exists as a homodimer in its native form and is adenosylcobalamin-dependent. The precursor form of human MCM is 750 amino acids, while its mature form is 718 amino acids\u2014a 32 amino acid leader sequence is cleaved off by mitochondrial importation and processing machinery. This leader sequence is variously referred to as MCM's mitochondrial targeting peptide, mitochondrial targeting sequence, or mitochondrial transit peptide.",
            "A complete or partial loss of MCM function leads to buildup of abnormal metabolites and metabolic intermediates upstream of MCM, such as methylmalonic acid, propionyl-carnitine, acetyl-carnitine, propionyl-CoA, D-methylmalonyl-CoA and L-methylmalonyl-CoA. For example, loss of MCM has been reported to lead to a 1000-fold increase in the methylmalonic acid. Nonetheless, there is no currently available therapeutic to treat MMA."

        "paragraph": [
            "Various approaches have been proposed to overcome allogeneic rejection of transplanted or engrafted cells including HLA-matching, blocking pathways that trigger T-cell activation with antibodies, use of a cocktail of immune suppressive drugs, and autologous cell therapy. Another strategy to dampen graft rejection involves minimization of allogenic differences between transplanted or engrafted cells and the recipient. The cell surface-expressed human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), molecules encoded by genes located in the human major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6, are the major mediators of immune rejection. Mismatch of a single HLA gene between the donor and subject can cause a robust immune response (Fleischhauer K. et al. \u201cBone marrow-allograft rejection by T lymphocytes recognizing a single amino acid difference in HLA-B44,\u201d N Engl J Med., 1990, 323:1818-1822). HLA genes are divided into MHC class I (MHC-I) and MHC class II (MHC-II). MHC-I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) are expressed in almost all tissue cell types, presenting \u201cnon-self\u201d antigen-processed peptides to CD8+ T cells, thereby promoting their activation to cytolytic CD8+ T cells. Transplanted or engrafted cells expressing \u201cnon-self\u201d MHC-I molecules will cause a robust cellular immune response directed at these cells and ultimately resulting in their demise by activated cytolytic CD8+ T cells. MHC-I proteins are intimately associated with beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for forming functional MHC-I molecules on the cell surface.",
            "In contrast to the wide cellular expression of MHC-I genes, expression of MHC-II genes is restricted to antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. HLA antigen genes are the most polymorphic genes observed in the human genome (Rubinstein P., \u201cHLA matching for bone marrow transplantation\u2014how much is enough?\u201d N Engl J Med., 2001, 345:1842-1844). The generation of a \u201cuniversal donor\u201d cell that is compatible with any HLA genotype provides an alternative strategy that could resolve the immune rejection and associated economical costs of current methodologies for immune evasion.",
            "To generate such a line of universal donor cell(s), one previous approach has been to functionally disrupt the expression of MHC-I and MHC-II class genes. This could be achieved through genetic disruption, e.g., of both genetic alleles encoding the MHC-I light chain, B2M. The resulting B2M-null cell line and its derivatives would be expected to exhibit greatly reduced surface MHC-I and thus, reduced immunogenicity to allogeneic CD8+ T cells. The transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) targeting approach has been used to generate B2M-deficient hESC lines by deletion of a few nucleotides in exon 2 of the B2M gene (Lu, P. et al., \u201cGenerating hypoimmunogenic human embryonic stem cells by the disruption of beta 2-microglobulin,\u201d Stem Cell Rev. 2013, 9:806-813). Although the B2M-targeted hESC lines appeared to be surface HLA-I deficient, they were found to still contain mRNAs specific for B2M and MHC-I. The B2M and MHC-I mRNAs were expressed at levels equivalent to those of untargeted hESCs (both constitutive and IFN-g induced). Thus, concern exists that these TALEN B2M-targeted hESC lines might express residual cell surface MHC-I that would be sufficient to cause immune rejection, such as has been observed with B2M2/2 mouse cells that also express B2M mRNA (Gross, R. and Rappuoli, R. \u201cPertussis toxin promoter sequences involved in modulation,\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci, 1993, 90:3913-3917). Although the TALEN B2M targeted hESC lines were not examined for off-target cleavage events, the occurrence of nonspecific cleavage when using TALENs remains a significant issue that would impose a major safety concern on their clinical use (Grau, J. et al. \u201cTALENoffer: genome-wide TALEN off-target prediction,\u201d Bioinformatics, 2013, 29:2931-2932; Guilinger J. P. et al. \u201cBroad specificity profiling of TALENs results in engineered nucleases with improved DNA-cleavage specificity,\u201d Nat Methods 2014, 11:429-435). Further, another report generated IPS cells that escaped allogeneic recognition by knocking out a first B2M allele and knocking in a HLA-E gene at a second B2M allele, which resulted in surface expression of HLA-E dimers or trimers in the absence of surface expression of HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C (Gornalusse, G. G. et al., \u201cHLA-E-expressing pluripotent stem cells escape allogeneic responses and lysis by NK cells,\u201d Nature Biotechnology, 2017, 35, 765-773).",
            "A potential limitation of some of the above strategies are that MHC class I-negative cells are susceptible to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells as HLA molecules serve as major ligand inhibitors to natural killer (NK) cells. Host NK cells have been shown to eliminate transplanted or engrafted B2M\u2212/\u2212 donor cells, and a similar phenomenon occurs in vitro with MHC class-I-negative human leukemic lines (Bix, M. et al., \u201cRejection of class I MHC-deficient haemopoietic cells by irradiated MHC-matched mice,\u201d Nature, 1991, 349, 329-331; Zarcone, D. et al., \u201cHuman leukemia-derived cell lines and clones as models for mechanistic analysis of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity,\u201d Cancer Res. 1987, 47, 2674-2682). Thus, there exists a need to improve upon previous methods to generate universal donor cells that can evade the immune response as well as a need to generate cells that can survive post-engraftment. As described herein, cell survival post-engraftment may be mediated by a host of other pathways independent of allogeneic rejection e.g., hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress. Also as described herein, genetic introduction of survival factors (genes and/or proteins) may help cells to survive post-engraftment. As described herein, a universal donor cell line may combine properties that address both allogeneic rejection and survival post-engraftment."

CTLN2 is also known as Adult-Onset Citrullinemia Type 2 or Citrin Deficiency. CTLN2 causes nocturnal delirium, aggression, irritability, hyperactivity, delusions, disorientation, restlessness, drowsiness, loss of memory, flapping tremor, convulsive seizures, coma, or even death resulting from brain edema. Kobayashi, K. et al., GeneReviews (2008); http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1181/. CTLN2 is found in the Japanese population with an estimated incidence of 1 in 100,000 to 230,000. Additionally, CTLN2 has been reported in East Asian and Middle Eastern populations. Current treatments for CTLN2 attempt to control signs and symptoms by having individuals consume diets that are low in carbohydrates and high in proteins and fats. Also, treatment with arginine, sodium benzoate, or sodium phenylacetate removes ammonia from the blood. In serious cases, liver transplantation has been successful in treating CTLN2 and dialysis can be used to remove ammonia from the blood. Saheki, T. et al., Molec. Genet. Metab. 100(Suppl. 1):S59-S64 (2010). Thus, most effective treatment for this disorder is liver transplantation, although many patients can be managed by a low-carbohydrate/high-protein diet.

Citrin is also known as Mitochondrial Aspartate Glutamate Carrier 2 or ARALAR2. Citrin plays a critical role in the urea cycle by catalyzing the mitochondrial uptake of glutamate and export of aspartate. Saheki, T. et al., Metab. Brain Dis. 17:335-346 (2002). Depending on the variant, the precursor form of human Citrin is either 676 or 675 amino acids, while its mature form is either 675 or 674 amino acids with the initiator methionine cleaved off.",

Aside from liver transplant, treatment for CTLN2 generally focuses on managing the disease, e.g., through diet and nutritional support. There are currently no available therapeutics to treat CTLN2.
